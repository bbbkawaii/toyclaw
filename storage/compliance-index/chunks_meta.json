These would include issuing new product instructions, making \nchanges to the product or conducting a product recall. \nRegarding enforcement and recalls, the EU operates the Rapid Alert System for Dangerous Non-Food \nProducts RAPEX.

CPSIA also introduced strict \nlimits on toxic substances: for example, lead in \nsurface coatings is capped at 90 ppm and total \nlead content at 100 ppm in accessible parts, and \ncertain phthalates are banned above 0.1% in toy \ncomponents.

Only laboratories that have \nbeen accredited and registered with the CPSC \ncan perform this testing, ensuring consistency \nand reliability in results. Once testing is \nsuccessfully completed, the U.S. importer or \ndomestic manufacturer must issue a Childrenʼs \nProduct Certificate CPC) certifying that the toy \ncomplies with all applicable federal toy safety \nstandards. The CPC references the tests and \nregulations (e.g., 16 C.F.R. Part 1250 for the toy \nstandard) and accompanies the product at \nimportation or distribution.

Firms selling in Canada often leverage \ntesting done for U.S. or EU markets, since Canadaʼs \nmechanical and chemical requirements are similar \n(with minor differences). For example, Canada \ncurrently does not require a specific “choking \nhazardˮ label on all toys with small parts (unlike the \nU.S.), but it does ban the sale of toys with small \nparts for under-3 children, just as others do.\n\nHealth Canadaʼs product safety officers \nconduct inspections at retailers, border \nchecks, and product inspections. If \nnon-compliance is found (e.g. a toy fails the \ndrop test and breaks into small parts, or \ncontains excessive lead or banned phthalates), \nauthorities can order a stop-sale, seize \nproducts, or negotiate recalls. The CCPSA also \nmandates incident reporting: if an incident (like \na child choking or a toy malfunction) occurs, \ncompanies must report it to Health Canada. \nThis helps the regulator identify hazardous \ntoys and take action.\nToys enter Canada without a pre-certification step, but importers should be prepared to \nshow test reports or evidence of compliance if inspected.\nIn essence, it serves a similar purpose to ASTM \nF963ʼs heavy metal limits or Europeʼs EN 713, \nensuring that children are not exposed to toxic \nelements from toys.

It bans toys and other\narticles that are intended for use by children under three\nand that are or have small parts, or that produce small\nparts when broken.\nWhich products must meet this regulation?\nThe regulation covers products that are intended for use\nby children under three.  These products include a wide\nrange of articles such as toys, dolls, and puzzles, nursery\nequipment, infant furniture and equipment such as\nplaypens, strollers, and baby bouncers and exercisers.\nSee 16 C.F.R.

Balloons, books and other articles made of\npaper, phonograph records, writing materials such\nas crayons, chalk, pencils and pens, modeling clay\nand similar products, and finger paints, watercolors\nand other paint sets are exempt because they cannot\nbe manufactured in a way that would prevent them\nfrom breaking into small parts when subjected to\nuse and abuse testing.

These\ntests simulate the forces that toys and products can\nexperience during normal use and abuse by children\nunder 3. If these forces cause parts to break off that fit in\nthe cylinder, those parts present a risk of choking,\naspiration or ingestion to children under 3.\n16 C.F.R. 1500.51 contains test procedures and forces\nthat simulate use and abuse by children 0-18 months of\nage. 16 C.F.R. 1500.52 contains test procedures and\nforces that simulate use and abuse by children 18-36\nmonths of age.\nAre there any other requirements intended to\nprotect children under 3 from choking on small\nparts?\nYes.

The initiative became the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, also \nknown as “Proposition 65” (Prop 65). The state published a list of chemicals known to cause cancer or \nbirth defects or other reproductive harm. The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) \nupdates this list annually and it now includes over 800 chemicals.\nWhat are the requirements?\nProp 65 requires businesses to notify Californians about significant amounts of the associated chemicals in \nthe products they purchase with ‘clear and reasonable’ warning labels. These labels will allow Californians \nto make informed decisions about protecting themselves from exposures to these chemicals.","market":"US","source":"California_Prop_65_White_Paper.pdf","section":"A EUROFINS WHITE PAPER"},{"id":"US/California_Prop_65_White_Paper.pdf#1","text":"the products they purchase with ‘clear and reasonable’ warning labels. These labels will allow Californians \nto make informed decisions about protecting themselves from exposures to these chemicals. Any business \nthat sells their product in California must be in compliance with Prop 65.\nHow is Prop 65 enforced?\nThe law does not ban or restrict the sale of products containing chemicals on the list. If companies meet \nthe requirements of the law through proper disclosure and labeling of products, they are protected from \nany legal action. Failing to disclose a Prop 65 listed chemical that is over the established safe harbor levels \nmay result in fines up to $2,500 per violation per day by California Attorney General’s Office, as well as \npotential lawsuits by private parties/citizens. \n\n4\nWhat are Safe Harbor Levels?\nThe OEHHA developed ‘safe harbor levels’ for chemicals contained on the list which allows a business to be \nexempt from Prop 65 warning requirements if exposure is at or below these levels. These established levels \nconsist of the following:\n• No Safe Harbor Level = no exemption\n• No Significant Risk Levels (NSRLs) for chemicals listed as carcinogens = exempt\n• Maximum Allowable Dose Levels (MADLs) for chemicals listed as causing birth defects or \nreproductive harm/toxicity = exempt if at or below level\nThe list of NSRLs and MADLs are provided in a “safe harbor” list for businesses. These NSRLs and MADLs \nare established in regulation in Title 27, Cal. Code of Regulations, Sections 25705, 25709, and 25805. If a \ncompany can provide other means of scientific proof that their product meets safe harbor levels, and prove \na low risk, then it is certainly advisable to do this. An example would be to have a certified toxicologist \nrender a conclusion based on facts, testing, and previous claims as to the appropriate Safe Harbors levels \nfor a particular chemical.","market":"US","source":"California_Prop_65_White_Paper.pdf","section":"A EUROFINS WHITE PAPER"},{"id":"US/California_Prop_65_White_Paper.pdf#2","text":"to do this.

You can find the full list online at The Office of Environmental Health Hazard \nAssessment (OEHHA)’s website.\nAdditionally, due to certain legislative action, specific food products have established limits. Some \nexamples include: \n• Seaweed: Inorganic Arsenic (10μg/day) Lead (15μg/day) Cadmium (4.1μg/day)\n• Tea Leaf: Lead (15μg/day)\n• Ginger: Lead (15μg/day)\n• Canned/ Bottled Item: BPA - Bisphenol A (3μg/day)\n• Caramel Color: 4-Methylimidazole (29μg/day)\nHow do I know which of the chemicals might be in my products?\nThere are many chemicals on the list, however not all are typically found in food products. Since many \nfood products are formulated with more than one raw material, it is important to start with your suppliers \nto determine if they have conducted research on their specific risks and related chemical exposure. Some \nof the common chemical risks are as follows:\n• Heavy Metals (Arsenic, Cadmium, Lead, Mercury) are found in soils all over the world and can be \nfound in naturally occurring amounts. They are taken up through the roots of the plants (e.g. lead in \nchocolate) or from the water (e.g. arsenic in rice).\n• Acrylamides are formed by high-temperature processes such as baking, roasting, and frying \nfoods (e.g. chips, coffee, bread). It is not added to food product or packaging and are not \nabsorbed environmentally.\n• 4-methylimidazole (4-MEI) is a byproduct formed in certain foods and beverages during the normal \nheating and browning processes and in some cases from fermentation. The chemical is a naturally \noccurring compound in certain caramel colors, roasted, and cooked foods; it is not added to \nthe product.","market":"US","source":"California_Prop_65_White_Paper.pdf","section":"A EUROFINS WHITE PAPER"},{"id":"US/California_Prop_65_White_Paper.pdf#3","text":"ating and browning processes and in some cases from fermentation.

Based on the comparison, take a moment to understand and further investigate measures to reduce \nthe levels (if present). Then take the next steps for consideration to minimize exposure (region, \nseasonality) if applicable.\nWhat do I do with the results?\nFirst, understand the limits are set in two parts:\nThe NSRL is a daily intake level calculated to result in one excess case of cancer in an exposed \npopulation of 100,000 assuming lifetime exposure. The MADL is the level at which the chemical \nwould have no observable adverse reproductive effect assuming exposure at 1,000 times that level. \nSecond, conduct a calculation of the results:\nA company must calculate an exposure analysis in their product to determine whether a warning is \nnecessary. The analysis further determines presence or absence of a chemical substance. If present, \neven in small quantities, the “consumption factor” must be taken into account. A business must \nmake their calculations based on serving size and potential to consume more than a serving size in \none day (e.g. could be eaten throughout the day). This additional calculation may lead to a value \nthat is over the limit and a warning must be placed on the product. See our handy calculation \nexample on the next page.","market":"US","source":"California_Prop_65_White_Paper.pdf","section":"7.

This additional calculation may lead to a value \nthat is over the limit and a warning must be placed on the product. See our handy calculation \nexample on the next page.\n\n6\nResult Calculation Examples.\nDue to the minute concentrations of several of these chemicals, nearly all are reported in ug/kg, which is \nthe same as ppb (parts per billion). In order to determine if your product is below or exceeds the limits set \nby Prop 65, you must first calculate the amount present per serving.\nSee the example below:\n• Serving Size = 40 grams\n• Acrylamide Result = 49 ug/kg (ppb)\n• To determine the amount of acrylamide per serving, the result is multiplied by the serving size (in \ngrams) and dividing by 1000.\n• 49 ug/kg = 0.049 ug / g x 40 g serving = 2.0 ug/serving\n• The acrylamide test reports in ug/kg (ppb). The ug/kg result is divided by 1000 to give the ug/g result; the \nug/g result is multiplied by the serving size in grams.\nAs of February 2019, the NSRL level for acrylamide is 0.2 ug/day and the MADL is 140 ug/day. Since there \nare a total of 2.0 ug of acrylamide in a serving it is reasonable to suggest that one would consume over \nthe NSRL which means the manufacturer would need to consider placing the respective warning on the \npackaging regarding its potential risk for cancer. \nUnderstanding ug/day and ug/serving is not the same measurement, the manufacturer must then consider \nthe reasonable daily consumption of the product to further determine what and if any warnings are \nnecessary for labeling.","market":"US","source":"California_Prop_65_White_Paper.pdf","section":"7.

U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Staff (CPSC staff) document titled, Age \nDetermination Guidelines: Relating Consumer Product Characteristics to the Skills, Play \nBehaviors, and Interests of Children, supersedes the (2002) Age Determination Guidelines: \nRelating Children’s Ages to Toy Characteristics and Play Behavior. \nThis document presents age-grading information in the form of guidelines for toys and other \narticles, children’s toys, child care articles, and children’s products. CPSC staff performs age \ndeterminations, in which the various characteristics of a consumer product are matched to the \nskills, play behaviors, and interests of children in a particular age group. For manufacturers, age \ngrading is an important step in developing, marketing, and labeling consumer products. Using \ninformation from the Age Determination Guidelines to determine w hether a general use product \nwould be appropriate for children is an important consideration for them as well. Once \nmanufacturers determine a target age for a product through age grading, CPSC staff encourages \nmanufacturers to label, promote, and market it to that age group. Accurate age labels provide \nparents and other consumers with guidance for selecting age-appropriate products for children. \nCPSC’s regulations have long required that consumer products be constructed to withstand the \nreasonably foreseeable uses and abuses of children within specified age groups. The Consumer \nProduct Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA) imposed new obligations, such as requiring \nmanufacturers of children’s products to certify, based on third-party testing, that their products \nmeet CPSC standards. The results of age determinations directly impact the type and severity of \nmechanical and chemical tests the samples may subsequently undergo to identify potential \nhazards.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"INTRODUCTION"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#17","text":"cts \nmeet CPSC standards.

To \naccomplish this goal, CPSC develops standards, pursues recalls, and in certain circumstances, \nissues bans on products that are intended for children of certain ages. Additionally, CPSC \nenforces numerous regulations under other statutes, some of which apply to products for children \nwithin specific age groups. For example, CPSC administers the Federal Hazardous Substances \nAct (FHSA),\n3\n under which it has issued certain regulations regarding toys and other articles. The \nChild Safety Protection Act (CSPA) of 1994 amended sections of the FHSA to require labeling \nof certain products that pose a choking hazard to children within a specified age range (e.g., \nsmall balls, balloons, marbles). The Labeling of Hazardous Art Materials Act (LHAMA),\n45\n \namended the FHSA to require labeling of all art materials determined to have a potential chronic \nhazard for health. One regulation issued under the FHSA with very specific age-specific \nrequirements is the Small Parts Regulation. \nSmall Parts Regulation\n6\n \nIn 1979, the Commission issued a regulation under provisions of the FHSA to ban certain toys \nand other articles that are intended for use by children under 3 years of age, if they present a \nchoking, aspiration, or ingestion hazard because of small parts. This regulation, known as the \nSmall Parts Regulation, is found in 16 CFR §§ 1500.18(a)(9), 1500.50–.52, and part 1501.  \nIntroduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of a banned item is a \nprohibited act under section 4 of the FHSA and subjects the firm to the penalties described in \nsection 5 of the FHSA.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"BACKGROUND"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#19","text":"tion or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of a banned item is a \nprohibited act under section 4 of the FHSA and subjects the firm to the penalties described in \nsection 5 of the FHSA.

For \nexample, children from 12 months through 18 months of age enjoy toys with bright colors, \nespecially yellows and reds, and toys with high contrast and patterns. Therefore, toys with \ncharacteristics such as these may be considered appropriate for children of this age. As specified \nin the Small Parts Regulation, staff also considers how the toy or other article is labeled, \nmarketed, advertised, and promoted. Although small parts that present a hazard are clearly \ninappropriate for children under 3 years of age, the mere presence of small parts does not \npreclude the possibility that CPSC staff would determine that product is intended for children \nunder the age of 3. Rather, when evaluating a product for age appropriateness, one ought to \nconsider whether parents and others would purchase the product for children under 3 years of \nage, based on its characteristics and the characteristics of children of this age. \nConsumer Product Safety Improvement Act \nIn 2008, Congress passed the CPSIA,\n7\n giving the Commission new regulatory and enforcement \ntools for addressing mechanical and chemical safety hazards in consumer products that are \nintended for children. Most notable for age grading, the law (1) mandated the ASTM F963 \nStandard Consumer Safety Specification for Toy Safety as a consumer product safety standard \n(incorporated by reference in 16 CFR part 1250), and (2) added a definition of “children’s \nproduct” in the CPSA.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"BACKGROUND"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#24","text":"rd Consumer Safety Specification for Toy Safety as a consumer product safety standard \n(incorporated by reference in 16 CFR part 1250), and (2) added a definition of “children’s \nproduct” in the CPSA. A children’s product is “a consumer product designed or intended \nprimarily for children 12 years of age or younger.” 15 USC 2052(a)(2). The definition states four \nfactors to consider. A manufacturer’s statement about intended use is one factor, but is not \ndeterminative. T he Age Determination Guidelines are the fourth criterion to consider when \ndetermining what constitutes a “children’s product” under the CPSA.  \nThe CPSIA also added requirements that consumer products that are “children’s products” must \nbe labeled with tracking labels and have valid Children’s Product Certificates (CPCs), based on \npassing third-party test results from a CPSC-accepted laboratory.

Additionally, products \nmeeting the “children’s toy” or “child care article” definitions are subject to specified phthalates \nprohibitions in CPSIA section 108 and 16 CFR part 1307. The regulation at 16 CFR part 1307 \nmade some changes to the list of prohibited phthalates in the CPSIA. Table 2 outlines the \nrelevant statutory and regulatory definitions and evaluation criteria that are applicable to age \ngrading. \nASTM F963 Toy Safety Standard \nASTM F963\n8\n Standard Consumer Safety Specification for Toy Safety is a comprehensive safety \nstandard covering performance requirements and test methods for addressing a wide range of \nsafety hazards in toys that are intended for children under 14 years of age (includes 13-year-old \nchildren). The status of ASTM F963 as a mandatory standard greatly expanded the scope and \nneed for age grading by CPSC staff, given the myriad age-specific requirements, wider age \nrange, and types of toys covered. The standard contains performance specifications to address a \nwide range of mechanical safety hazards (e.g., projectiles, batteries, strings and cords, noise, \nmagnets, and expanding materials), as well as chemical hazards (e.g., lead, cadmium, antimony, \narsenic, barium, chromium, mercury, and selenium), in toys. Many of the performance \nrequirements in the standard have age limits, which were developed in response to known safety \nhazards and/or the expected cognitive, physical development, and interests of children in a \ncertain age group.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"BACKGROUND"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#26","text":"ments in the standard have age limits, which were developed in response to known safety \nhazards and/or the expected cognitive, physical development, and interests of children in a \ncertain age group.

The law at § 108(g)(1)(B) defines “children’s toy” as “a \nconsumer product designed or intended by the manufacturer for a child 12 years of age or \nyounger, for use by the child when the child plays.”  Section 108(g)(2) of the CPSIA lists four \ncriteria to determine whether a product meets the definition of “children’s toy.” Staff applies \nthose criteria in the same manner as the similar four criteria for the definition of “children’s \nproduct” in section 3(a)(2) of the CPSA. \nChild Care Article \nIn determining whether the prohibited phthalates requirements apply to a particular product, \nCPSC staff may evaluate whether the product meets the definition of a “child care article” in \nCPSIA. The term “child care article” is defined in section 108(b)(3)(e)(1)(C) of the CPSIA as a \n“consumer product designed or intended by the manufacturer to facilitate sleep or the feeding of \nchildren age 3 and younger, or to help such children with sucking or teething.” Staff uses the \nsame criteria to make determinations of children's toys in section 108 as it uses to identify \nproducts as a “child care article.” \nChildren’s Products \nCPSC staff often evaluates whether a consumer product meets the definition of a “children’s \nproduct” in section 3(a)(2) of the CPSA, as amended by the CPSIA in 15 USC 2052(a)(2).","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"BACKGROUND"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#30","text":"Children’s Products \nCPSC staff often evaluates whether a consumer product meets the definition of a “children’s \nproduct” in section 3(a)(2) of the CPSA, as amended by the CPSIA in 15 USC 2052(a)(2).

Children’s \ncognitive development, which includes creativity, discovery, language skills, verbal judgment \nand reasoning, symbolic thought, problem-solving skills, and the ability to focus and control \nbehavior, are all heavily influenced by children’s play experiences.  Children’s emotional \ndevelopment, which is also shaped by their play, includes feelings of happiness, feelings of \ncontrol over their environment, emotional awareness, sensitivity to others, emotional strength \nand stability, spontaneity, humor, and feelings about self. Social learning occurs largely during \nchildren’s play interactions, as children learn to play in larger and larger groups, and as they \nbegin to learn about appropriate behaviors within certain contexts.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"A USER GUIDE TO THE AGE DETERMINATION GUIDELINES"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#34","text":"al learning occurs largely during \nchildren’s play interactions, as children learn to play in larger and larger groups, and as they \nbegin to learn about appropriate behaviors within certain contexts.

The primary content of the Age Determination Guidelines is organized into four levels, \neach representing an increasing level of detail. These levels are play categories, product \nsubcategories, age groups, and product characteristics. \nPlay Categories \nThe play category level consists of eight main groups that serve as the primary structure of the \nAge Determination Guidelines. The main groups apply to the various play behaviors in which \nchildren engage and how they use products during play. The main play categories are: (1) \nExploratory and Practice Play, (2) Building Play, (3) Pretend & Role Play, (4) Game & Activity \nPlay, (5) Sports, Recreational, & Outdoor Play, (6) Media Play, (7) Educational & Academic \nPlay, and (8) Technology Play.  These eight categories provide the largest organizational strategy \nfor the Age Determination Guidelines, and they essentially represent the “chapters” of the \ndocument, as evidenced from the Contents.

A 2017 survey by Common Sense \nMedia revealed that children from birth to 8 years continue to spend more than 2 hours each day \nwith television, DVDs, computers, video games, and mobile devices. Through these devices, \nchildren are able to access games, music, programming, as well as fully use features of products \nthat are compatible with these devices. Many of the same factors from traditional products for \nchildren (e.g., classic toys and games) relate similarly to age appropriateness of technology play; \nalthough there are specific issues to consider that are addressed in that section. Because \ntechnology is rapidly evolving, this section needs frequent updates as new technologies enter the \nmarket. \nProduct Subcategories \nEach play category is divided into two to five subcategories.

These abilities and \npreferences play an important role in attracting and motivating children to interact with products. \nDeveloping physically, for example, changes the ways in which children are able to coordinate \ntheir gross motor skills. Increased mobility opens up new ways to use products. A higher level of \nfine motor skill permits greater manipulation of objects. Ultimately, such knowledge helps to \nidentify and distinguish the characteristics of products that are of interest to children at a given \nage. Although information of this sort is noted throughout the Age Determination Guidelines in \nrelation to a specific subcategory of products, this section summarizes average play behaviors, \nregardless of the product used; and it identifies appropriate product characteristics that are \ngenerally consistent among all subcategories of products. With this information, it will be easier \nfor the reader to make an age determination for a given product, even if it is not specifically \naddressed within the Age Determination Guidelines. \nBirth Through 3 Months \nObject play is limited during this period because learning occurs mostly through the reflexive \nactions of the child, such as spontaneous kicking or arm movements. They are manipulating \nobjects so that they may explore them, repetitively.  Initially, they explore with their eyes and \nears only. Newborns can focus best at about 8 inches from their faces, but this increases over \ntime, and they may be able to see objects several feet away by the end of this period.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"A USER GUIDE TO THE AGE DETERMINATION GUIDELINES"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#45","text":"h their eyes and \nears only.

Play objects \nshould fit within their visual field at these distances. They are attracted to bright and vibrant \ncolors, especially yellows and reds, and to objects with high-contrast patterns, like black and \nwhite spirals. These children prefer the human face to all other patterns, and will watch faces \nintently. They will turn their heads in the direction of a sound, and are more attracted to objects \nthat emit a gentle, soothing sound and that move slowly, than to objects that remain still or are \ntoo loud, too sudden, or otherwise extreme. Much of children’s play at this age involves \nwatching and exploring their own body. They have a reflexive grasp, which only allows them to \nexplore objects briefly; and at 3 months, they begin to swipe or reach toward a dangling object to \ngrasp it.

Therefore, soft, lightweight, washable, easy-to-grip objects with \nrounded corners are best. The preference for soft-material toys is greatest for 3-month-olds and \ndeclines as children reach their first birthday.  They start to learn and enjoy toys for which simple \nactions produce a clear, direct effect; for example, toys that light up, move, or create sound as a \nresult of simple kicking or shaking. Brightly colored and patterned toys that make gentle sounds \nare both engaging and appropriate for these children. \n4 Through 7 Months \nChildren now actively engage with their environments in systematic ways. Distance vision is \nmore mature, and these children can track moving objects with smooth, efficient eye movements. \nBright colors, high contrasts, and complex patterns continue to be of interest. These children \nlearn to differentiate among objects, as evidenced by their ability to group visual stimuli into \ncategories. By 5 months of age, children can roll onto their backs and push up onto their hands \nand knees. They have mastered the ability to grasp and manipulate a dangling object by 6 \nmonths, and they begin to engage in more active play by reaching, grasping, tugging, pushing, \npatting, shaking, and squeezing objects. At 6 to 7 months, children are sitting independently, \nwhich provides them with greater visual capacities for grasping objects or bringing objects to \nmidline for exploration. They can manipulate objects more readily, although their fine motor \ncoordination is still rudimentary. Objects are grasped using a claw-like grip or raking motion, \nrather than a pincer grasp (i.e., using the thumb and index finger).","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"A USER GUIDE TO THE AGE DETERMINATION GUIDELINES"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#47","text":"eadily, although their fine motor \ncoordination is still rudimentary.

These children continue to mouth objects, so \nsuitable toys are washable. \nNear the end of this period, children develop the ability to recognize oft-repeated words, and \nsome are beginning to crawl and stand with support. At this time, they are also beginning to \nunderstand object permanence—that an object that is hidden or partially hidden did not actually \ndisappear, but still exists somewhere. Soft, lightweight, rounded, and textured toys that make \ngentle sounds are appropriate. Handheld toys should be sized so these children can easily grasp \nand manipulate them. \n\nChildren’s Basic Abilities and Preferences \n21 \n8 Through 11 Months \nMuch of the play during this period focuses on developing gross motor skills as these children \nexhibit more outwardly oriented movements and become increasingly mobile. They can crawl \nforward and backward, pull themselves into a standing position, walk with support (e.g., along \nfurniture), stand momentarily without support, and complete a couple of unassisted steps. They \nalso begin to climb. These children explore objects in many different ways, such as through \ngrasping, shaking, squeezing, throwing, dropping, passing from hand to hand, and banging. \nAlthough they can hold two objects and bang them together, they cannot coordinate the \nmovements of both to use them together. However, when given one object, children in this age \nspan can use both of their hands at the same time, with each hand performing a different, but \ncomplementary, action on the object.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"A USER GUIDE TO THE AGE DETERMINATION GUIDELINES"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#48","text":"them together. However, when given one object, children in this age \nspan can use both of their hands at the same time, with each hand performing a different, but \ncomplementary, action on the object.  Usually, one hand is in a supporting or stabilizing role, \nwhile the other manipulates or explores the object.  They begin to develop a pincer grasp, which \nis used to pick up small objects between the thumb and fingers. Patterns of exploratory play \nbegin that suggest children near the older end of this age group can make inferences about novel \nobjects. For example, these children may infer what functions may operate beneath the surface of \nan object. They explore objects from every angle, and this often involves mouthing. Therefore, \nsuitable toys are washable. \nMany children in this age group begin to use items in relational patterns; for example, they enjoy \ndumping items out of a container, putting them back in, and then repeating the process. They \nrepeat pleasurable actions often, and start to show an interest in marking on paper. Basic memory \nskills are developing, and object permanence becomes more entrenched. When a toy is hidden or \nnot within view, these children know the toy still exists and did not simply disappear. Children of \nthis age can understand simple words related to their immediate context, and need repetition and \nreinforcement of the words they hear. At the end of this period, these children begin to imitate \ngestures and the use of products. Sensory toys are highly attractive because these children are \nbeginning to understand simple cause-and-effect relationships. Bright colors, especially yellows \nand reds, continue their appeal for this age group, as do high contrasts and complex patterns. \nPictures that represent familiar objects are also highly attractive.

However, they are still unsteady on their \nfeet, and their walking resembles toddling more than mature heel-to-toe walking. Now they want \nto explore everything; however, their curiosity far outweighs their judgment for predicting \noutcomes or foreseeing dangers. They are trying out a variety of basic gross and fine motor \nskills, and are gaining confidence as climbers. They can sing to themselves and will move their \nbodies to music. Being more mobile, they can self-select toys that were once outside their reach. \nThey find basic grasping easier, and can manipulate toys that require simple twisting, turning, \nsliding, and cranking. Through trial and error, they continue to explore cause-and-effect \nrelationships like dumping and filling activities a nd stacking and knocking over objects. Children \nat this age display a preference for toys that have greater manipulability and sound potential.  \nThey enjoy a variety of actions with objects, such as pressing, pushing, pulling, rolling, \npounding, beating, shaking, clanging, fitting (for example, inserting a round peg into a round \nhole), marking, scribbling, carrying, and poking their fingers into objects. They delight in the \nmany effects their actions cause, and enjoy toys that take advantage of this. Children of this age \ncan recognize the names of familiar people, objects, pictures, and body parts.

By 1 \nyear, on average, children are able to show appreciation of sociocultural uses of objects and \nattend to cause-and-effect relations, which emerges between 13 and 20 months. For example, the \nchild may start to pretend to eat something from a plate.  Between 13 and 20 months, they \ndevelop greatly in their ability to engage in symbolic play.  They can defer imitating something \nfor up to a week, and can also do so across a change in context (for example, from daycare to \nhome).

They can pull a toy behind them while walking, \nclimb onto and off of furniture without assistance, walk up and down stairs with assistance, \nand—by the end of this period—may be able to kick a ball. They can now pick up and \nmanipulate much smaller objects due to their more developed pincer grasp. They like to sort \nobjects, often grouping them into two categories, and can now fit together simple objects.  \nChildren in this age group can match angles, which allows them to fit a square peg into a square \nhole. They can also start to use very simple coupling mechanisms like magnets, large hooks, and \nhook-and-loop or touch fasteners. At 19 months, children can now engage in true building play. \nRepresentational and symbolic thinking emerges during this timeframe, and children understand \nthat some toys represent other objects. The child’s depiction of representational art, however, is \nstill in its infancy and may seem nonrepresentational to adults. Most of their artistic forays take \nthe form of gestures, or a series of dots may represent, for example, a rabbit hopping. They can \nuse simple phrases, a few active verbs, and directional words, such as “up,” “down,” and “in.” \nSocial play also emerges because children of this age can now communicate with and play \nalongside each other. These children can role-play a variety of commonly observed actions, such \nas sleeping and making dolls or stuffed animals assume roles, such as play partners.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"A USER GUIDE TO THE AGE DETERMINATION GUIDELINES"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#52","text":"ate with and play \nalongside each other.

When \nplaying pretend with children, parents are usually sensitive to the needs of their children, \nsuggesting play at the same or slightly higher level of complexity than their children would \nnormally play. Although they still use trial and error, these children can mentally consider \nsolutions to problems before taking any action. This means they can remember and work with \nmental representations of familiar objects, pictures, letters, and numbers as they ponder \nappropriate actions. They are more goal-oriented,  and object permanence is more advanced. \nThese children can help dress or undress themselves. Toys with low-to-moderate cause-and-\neffect features—such as those with push buttons or pull cords that cause actions or sounds—are \nattractive to these children. \n\nChildren’s Basic Abilities and Preferences \n24 \n2 Years \nNow that pretend play is established, 2-year-olds can perform social roles like mommy, daddy, \nor baby. Role taking becomes a bigger part of social pretend play, and their pretend play \nbecomes more elaborate as they use a variety of objects to carry out longer episodes. At this age, \nchildren need the object to resemble the real item to some degree, so they might use a cloth \nrather than a shoe to represent a pillow.  They understand that pictures can depict pretend \nobjects, and scribbles gradually become more representational pictures during this period, \nalthough they are still more interested in the process than the product.

Toys with flaps, spinners, and rattling objects for \nexploration (such as beads on elastic, or a small ball with internal beads) are of interest to \nchildren in this age group. Examples of cognitive and motor manipulative toys for 4- through 7-\nmonth-olds include teething toys, rattles, lightweight balls (such as musical, chiming, grasping, \nspecial effects, and textured balls), multi-textured and multisensory infant toys, manipulative \npanels, activity gyms, play mats, cloth toys, plush toys, squeeze and squeak toys, plastic discs on \na ring, and interlocking plastic rings. The youngest children in this age range may show an \ninterest in mobiles. However, starting at about 5 months of age, when children begin to push up \nonto their hands and knees, or begin to sit up, mobiles, suspended crib gyms, and similar toys are \nno longer appropriate because they can pose a strangulation hazard. Mirrors may be attached to a \ncrib or wall. Handheld mirrors should have soft edges and handles that fit into their hands.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"EXPLORATORY AND PRACTICE PLAY"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#62","text":"toys are \nno longer appropriate because they can pose a strangulation hazard.

Due to an increase in physical and cognitive development, \nchildren of this age are beginning to understand simple cause-and-effect relationships. Some \nchildren begin to crawl and stand with support by 8 months of age. Very short tunnels (2 feet or \nless) with mirrors or viewing panels (top or side) that allow for eye contact with a caregiver may \nfacilitate crawling in some children. The motor skills of grasping and shaking, or patting, \ncombined with the cognitive skill of understanding cause and effect, make multisensory toys \nhighly attractive to this age group.

Children of this age can hold two objects at once, but they are unable to \ncoordinate the different actions of each hand. Because their physical abilities are increasing, but \nthey lack the coordination to completely control their own actions, their potential for getting \ninjured increases. Children in this age group are beginning to show an interest in object \ndisplacement, and they practice fine motor skills, such as grasping, pushing, pulling, squeezing, \npatting, poking, and shaking. Mouthing and teething are still very characteristic of this age \ngroup, although the time spent mouthing varies among children. When a toy is hidden or not \nwithin view, children in this age group know the toy still exists and did not simply disappear. \nSuitable manipulative and mirror toys for children 8 through 11 months old have characteristics \nsimilar to those for younger children. Children of this age also enjoy toys with containers \nbecause they like to put things into them and then dump out the contents. Exploratory toys with \nlarge dials, levers, wood flaps that change color and click and clack, rattle beads on elastic, and \npress buttons may be introduced. Examples of cognitive and motor manipulative toys for \nchildren in this age group include mirrors, teething toys, lightweight balls (such as musical, \nchiming, grasping, special effects, and textured balls), multi-textured and multisensory infant \ntoys, manipulative panels, activity gyms, cloth toys, plush toys, squeeze and squeak toys, nesting \ntoys, sorting toys, stacking toys, simple cause-and-effect toys, such as pop-up toys and roly-poly \ntoys, large beads on rings, and plastic keys on rings.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"EXPLORATORY AND PRACTICE PLAY"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#64","text":"plush toys, squeeze and squeak toys, nesting \ntoys, sorting toys, stacking toys, simple cause-and-effect toys, such as pop-up toys and roly-poly \ntoys, large beads on rings, and plastic keys on rings.

Although they are \nbecoming more skilled at walking, they are still unsteady on their feet, and they often lose their \nbalance. They are engaged in activities that develop their physical strength. They are developing \ngreater fine motor coordination. They are capable of controlled grasping and releasing, pushing, \npulling, squeezing, patting, poking, and shaking, and can twist, turn, slide, and crank toys. Toys \nthat combine these options are especially attractive—such as a squeezable ball with beads \ninterlaced on elastic.  A toy like this can be squeezed, shaken, or used for fine motor practice as \nthe child slowly moves the beads across the elastic. They are even more expansively exploring \nthe world through all their senses: seeing, hearing, touching, tasting, and smelling. \nSuitable manipulative and mirror toys for children 12 through 18 months old are of a size and \nweight that is easy to grasp and carry, rounded, and lightweight, but sturdy. Toys that are \nbrightly colored with high contrast are attractive to children in this age group.

Other exploratory toys that older \nchildren enjoy are foam clay,  and moldable (wet texture) sand for squeezing between their hands \nand using with molds and for early sculpting activities. Age 3 is the youngest appropriate age, \ndue to the lower incidence of mouthing and ingestion. Younger children are also tempted to stick \nclay or sand onto inappropriate objects (clothes, shoes).

They are often \noperated with a string or a handle, and almost always travel on wheels of some kind. Most \nchildren younger than 6 months cannot sit unsupported, and most are unable to move around \nuntil about 7 months of age. Therefore, push and pull toys are generally inappropriate for most \nchildren younger than 6 or 7 months. Since toys in this subcategory are most appropriate for the \nchild who is crawling or just beginning to walk, representational push and pull toys are not \ndiscussed here. For those types of toys, please see Pretend & Role Play: Small Vehicle Toys or \nPretend & Role Play: Tools & Props. \nOne should place primary emphasis or importance on the following characteristics when \ndetermining the age appropriateness of push and pull toys: \n• Motor Skills Required \n• Color/Contrast \n• Level of Realism/Detail \nThe order of the above characteristics does not necessarily indicate priority because this can \nchange with age.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"EXPLORATORY AND PRACTICE PLAY: MIRRORS, MOBILES, & MANIPULATIVES"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#81","text":"h and pull toys: \n• Motor Skills Required \n• Color/Contrast \n• Level of Realism/Detail \nThe order of the above characteristics does not necessarily indicate priority because this can \nchange with age.

Most \nchildren now actively handle toys. They are learning to reach, grasp, push, pull, squeeze, pat, \npoke, and shake.

Children of this age are most interested in push toys that are brightly \ncolored with high contrast, and these toys should be washable. Appropriate cause-and-effect \nrelationships are simple; for example, a toy may make a noise when the infant pulls it. Sensory \nelements are not too loud, too bright, too sudden, or otherwise extreme. Realistic detail is not \npreferred at this age, and children in this age group generally lack the fine motor skills to operate \ntoys that use handles and strings. \n8 Through 11 Months \nAs these children become more mobile, their behaviors become more goal-oriented and objects \nin their environment attract them.

They are often engaged in activities that develop their strength. \nIn general, push and pull toys for children 12 through 18 months old have characteristics similar \nto those for younger children. However, children in this age group are also now able to use push \ntoys with high upright handles or rigid rods with large attached handles, especially because they \ncan be used to help stabilize unsteady walkers. Some children at this age may even have \nadvanced enough gross motor skills to walk or run quickly with walkers. They are not yet able to \nuse pull toys with cords if the child must stand to use them, because cords do not provide \nsupport. Toys of that kind require more advanced walking and better body skills. In addition, \nthey require the child to look over his or her shoulder while walking to fully enjoy them. Small \npull toys with short cords that the child can use while remaining seated are suitable though. \n19 Through 23 Months \nRepresentational and symbolic thinking emerges between 19 and 23 months.

Building play can be characterized by the lack of a single organizational format; the \nmaterials largely determine the organization of the play. Simply defined, “building play” \ninvolves using materials,  such as blocks, to build something. True building play generally begins \nin early childhood around 19 months of age and continues into adulthood. Younger children \nadvance from simply handling objects and materials, to actively using them for constructing or \nbuilding with a preconceived plan in mind. They begin to manipulate objects with the intention \nof creating something, such as towers or houses. Until the age of 19 months, blocks are used \nprimarily as grasping objects in the environment. Most block sets are appropriate for children 19 \nmonths and older, with the materials differing most notably in size and weight. Note that larger \nsets than are developmentally appropriate may be introduced to children where only a portion of \nthe pieces are presented to the child. \nOne should place primary emphasis or importance on the following characteristics when \ndetermining the age appropriateness of blocks: \n• Motor Skills Required \n• Number of Parts \n• Size of Parts \n• Materials \n• Cause & Effect \n• Sensory Elements \n• Shape of Parts \nThe order of the above characteristics does not necessarily indicate priority because this can \nchange with age.

This includes a description \nof what types of blocks are appropriate and how a particular age group plays with these toys. \n\nBuilding Play: Blocks \n58 \nBirth Through 3 Months \nAt this age, child play is limited to exercising reflexes. During this phase of infancy, children \nreflexively open their mouths when their cheeks are brushed, so appropriate blocks are too large \nto fit into their mouths. Before 3 months, most children do not have the physical abilities to grasp \nor manipulate objects. During the first months of life, children use visual observation to engage \nin play. Research studies find that children can differentiate red from green, even at birth, and \nthat by 2 months of age, all color receptors are functioning. By 3 months, children prefer yellow \nand red over blue and green and highly contrasting patterns over solids. Therefore, bright yellow \nand red blocks, and those with high visual contrasts and patterns, are more attractive to children \nin this age group. Blocks made of soft/plush materials (like skinned foam or pillow blocks to \nprevent liberation of small parts during play) or covered in plastic or cloth are appropriate for \nthese children. Blocks with rounded edges may avoid potential eye injury. \n4 Through 7 Months \nAt this age, movements are progressing from involuntary reflexes to outwardly oriented \nmovements. As the child matures, grasping, reaching, shaking,  and pulling become ways to \ninteract with the environment. Grasping is mastered around 6 months, so children can now \nhandle toy blocks. Grasping a block triggers the sucking reflex, so children in this age group will \nimmediately put blocks they can grasp into their mouths. Therefore, blocks should be designed to \navoid the possibility of choking. Motor skills are crude at this age; thus, blocks must be designed \nso children can easily grasp them (e.g., by making them less than 4 inches across).","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"BUILDING PLAY"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#94","text":"be designed to \navoid the possibility of choking.

Blocks that \nare soft or plush are safer for the eyes and faces of children in this age group when they make \nerratic arm motions. Visually, this age group’s abilities are consistent with younger children, \npreferring red and yellow and patterns. Because 4- through 7-month-old children use blocks in \nexploratory play rather than true building play, blocks that are appropriate for this age group \ninclude those that are made from soft/plush materials like hollow plastic, vinyl, or foam. Larger \nblocks (more than 3 inches across) with rounded edges are appropriate for children in this age \ngroup, as are blocks that are patterned or colored red or yellow. \n\nBuilding Play: Blocks \n59 \n8 Through 11 Months \nFrom 8 through 11 months, children’s behaviors become more outwardly oriented and their \nhand-  eye coordination is becoming more refined. In addition, this age brings the cognitive ability \nto understand simple cause-and-effect relationships. This, together with the motor skill of \nshaking, make sensory blocks highly attractive for this age group. Soft blocks with jingle bells or \nrattles inside, or blocks that squeak when squeezed, are attractive and cognitively stimulating. \nAdditionally, children at this age enjoy battery-operated blocks that bounce, vibrate, or light up \nwhen handled. Developing fine motor skills make squeezing a highly engaging activity. Blocks \nthat can be squeezed (e.g., those made from hollow plastic or foam) aid in this development, and \nthose between 3 and 5 inches permit easy grasping and carrying. Blocks are not yet used as \nbuilding play materials, so providing them as manipulatives to aid in the child’s development is \nappropriate (see Exploratory and Practice Play: Mirrors, Mobiles, & Manipulatives).","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"BUILDING PLAY"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#95","text":"e not yet used as \nbuilding play materials, so providing them as manipulatives to aid in the child’s development is \nappropriate (see Exploratory and Practice Play: Mirrors, Mobiles, & Manipulatives).

Children of this age can \nhold two objects at once, meaning twice as many things are available to choke on or to be hit \nwith as they bang the two things together. Appropriate soft/plush blocks are larger than 3 inches \nacross, have rounded edges, are easily grasped, are colorful, and are multisensory. Children in \nthis age group are particularly attracted to blocks that incorporate sounds. Cube-shaped blocks \nare easy for them to grasp and bang together.

Once a stack of blocks is built, they want to knock it down right away \nwith their hands or feet. Therefore, appropriate blocks are those that are not hazardous to \nchildren as they are knocked down. Large, heavy wooden unit blocks—also known as \nkindergarten blocks—are not appropriate because of their weight, size, and hard corners. \nGrasping is a much easier task during this phase of life, so smaller blocks (2 to 4 inches) may be \nappropriate. \nChildren in this age group are becoming capable of making combinations of two to three objects, \nwhich makes nesting blocks engaging. Children have the physical motor and coordination skills \nnecessary to manipulate the nesting task and have the emerging cognitive abilities to understand \nthat the blocks go together in a predetermined way. Although children at this age will not make \npredetermined structures with magnetic blocks, they find it exciting to click and unclick blocks if \nthey have internal magnets.  The exploration interest of children can be incorporated into their \nblocks, as well. Blocks that have “curiosities” built into them provide children with an \nexploration toy. For instance, hollow blocks that resemble a cage and have something inside that \ncan be “freed” would be attractive to children in this age group.

Blocks that are too \ncumbersome or too heavy are of little interest because they are more difficult to manipulate. \nChildren in this age group find knocking down just as important as building.

Therefore, \nappropriate blocks are those that are not hazardous to children as they are knocked down, unlike \nheavy wooden unit blocks or kindergarten blocks.

pillow \nblocks do. Interlocking building materials are similar in nature to blocks because they may be \nused to build something that represents an item in the physical world. However, they differ from \nblocks significantly because of their ability to be joined, locked, or stay in a particular placement. \nThrough various connecting styles, pieces are snapped together to make creations that would be \nimpossible with traditional wooden table blocks. \nTrue building play begins around 19 months of age and continues into adulthood. This play is \nlinked to children’s development because engaging in building play is evidence of children’s \nprogress. Children advance from simply handling objects and materials in their play to actively \nusing them for constructing or building with a pre-conceived plan in mind. They begin to \nmanipulate objects with the intention of creating something, such as a tower or a house. Children \nyounger than 19 months of age generally lack the manipulative skills necessary to use \ninterlocking building materials effectively. Therefore, the discussion in this subcategory starts at \n19 months. \nOne should place primary emphasis or importance on the following characteristics when \ndetermining the age appropriateness of interlocking building materials: \n• Interlocking/Loose Parts \n• Motor Skills Required \n• Number of Parts \n• Size of Parts \nThe order of the above characteristics does not necessarily indicate priority because this can \nchange with age.

Because children in this age group \ncan manipulate toys with more ease due to their ever-increasing fine motor skills, interlocking \nblock sets with simple connecting systems are suitable. Sets of large, chunky plastic bricks that \ncan be easily stacked or pressed together in a non-systematic way are often the earliest \nappropriate interlocking system for children in this age group. Interlocking building sets that are \n2 to 4 inches in size and 20 to 30 in quantity are appropriate. Plastic is an appropriate material for \nthese blocks. \n2 Years \nPlay with interlocking building materials for 2-year-olds is very much the same as it is for the \nprevious age group. They participate in symbolic representation with their constructions, so a \nstack of blocks may represent a tree. Therefore, appropriate interlocking building materials for 2-\nyear-old children are the same as those for 19- through 23-month-old children: 2 to 4 inches \nacross, plastic, and 20 to 30 pieces. Children this age can manage a simple screwing action, but \nnot other types of coordination like fitting a bolt into a flat piece of wood and attaching a nut. \n3 Years \nThree-year-old children can use interlocking building materials in purposeful ways, which \nusually takes the form of stacking in an upward direction.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"INTERLOCKING BUILDING MATERIALS"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#110","text":"flat piece of wood and attaching a nut. \n3 Years \nThree-year-old children can use interlocking building materials in purposeful ways, which \nusually takes the form of stacking in an upward direction.

In addition, children at younger ages are more likely to use the suction cups as a \nmanipulative or as a fun item to chew or suck on.  Rod and spool connector pieces also require a \nfair amount of gross and fine motor skills that emerge around the age of 3--gross motor skills are \nneeded to push and snap them together, and fine motor skills are necessary to align a dowel into \nthe hole of a spool connector.  Children may use rod and spool connector pieces to build familiar \nobjects at this age, such as making a lollipop or a set of wheels.   However, on average, they lack \nthe cognitive ability to follow assembly directions, so interlocking model kits are not \nappropriate. Instead, open-ended materials that allow children to create their own ideas are \nattractive. Plastic and wood are appropriate materials, as are a variety of shapes, and an \nincreasing number of pieces (30 to 50).

Picture-based instructions are most helpful at this age due to still-developing reading skills.  \n6 Through 8 Years, 9 Through 12 Years \nEarly elementary age children find building with interlocking pieces highly interesting, much \nmore so than building sets that involve non-interlocking blocks. By the time children have \nreached these ages, they have developed the cognitive abilities to follow directions and to \nunderstand multi-step sequences, so working on complex model kits is appropriate. Theme- and \nmovie-based kits hold a high level of appeal, as do kits that produce realistic, detailed models. \nFine motor skills are generally well developed, so small pieces present relatively little difficulty. \nThey can build with sets using tiny screws, gears, nuts and bolts, and all-metal parts. The \nappropriate number of parts varies according to the child and the planned design, but there is \nessentially no limit to the number of parts for these ages. Generally, 100 pieces or more are \nneeded to provide sufficient material for children in this age group to build their designs.

and begin to make symbolic connections between a toy and \na real-life object or person, they are laying the foundation for pretend and role-play. On average, \nchildren begin rudimentary pretend and role-play with toys around 19 months of age.

Often they become a child’s \nfirst sensory objects. Children sometimes become attached to dolls and stuffed toys to feel a \nsense of security or to show affection. Such attachment may last through preschool and into the \nelementary school years. As cognitive abilities increase, dolls, action figures, and stuffed toys, \nserve an important symbolic function in helping children learn to pretend and role-play. Older \nchildren collect their favorite dolls, action figures, or stuffed toys. \nOne should place primary emphasis or importance on the following characteristics when \ndetermining the age appropriateness of dolls & stuffed toys: \n• Level of Realism/Detail \n• Cause & Effect \n• Size of Parts \n• Licensed theme \n• Color/Contrast \nThe order of these characteristics does not necessarily indicate priority because this can change \nwith age. The remaining discussion describes the relationship between the characteristics of \nthese toys and the characteristics of children in various age groups. This includes a description of \nwhat types of dolls and stuffed toys are appropriate and how a particular age group plays with \nthese toys. \nBirth Through 3 Months \nChildren this age mostly enjoy sensing and feeling objects. They lack fine motor control, so dolls \nand stuffed toys that are very lightweight (½ to 2 ounces) and have an easy-to-grip size—for \nexample, with limbs ¼-inch thick and lengths of 4 to 8 inches—are appropriate. They are more \nappealing when they have a soft, felt-like texture, like plush toys, have highly contrasting colors \n(for example, black and white) or basic contrasting patterns and faces, or have rich, vibrant \ncolors.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"BUILDING PLAY: INTERLOCKING BUILDING MATERIALS"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#123","text":"ealing when they have a soft, felt-like texture, like plush toys, have highly contrasting colors \n(for example, black and white) or basic contrasting patterns and faces, or have rich, vibrant \ncolors.

Clothing and moving eyes are not particularly appealing to this age \ngroup, and stuffed animals should have facial features that are sewn. Dolls and stuffed toys with \nvery basic, one-piece construction are appropriate, and should be sturdy enough not to break or \npull apart. \n4 Through 7 Months \nDolls and stuffed toys remain soft, lightweight, and simple in design for this age group. Besides \nthose characteristics described for younger children, children in this age group begin to \nappreciate highly contrasting facial features. A high degree of realism or detail is not \nrecommended. Children in this age group enjoy toys with simple cause-and-effect features; for \nexample, dolls or stuffed toys with rattles inside them. They can best handle lightweight toys that \nweigh no more than 2 ounces. Toys that are 4 to 12 inches in length are appropriate. Children in \nthis age group tend to mouth most objects, so dolls or stuffed toys with buttons, whiskers, bells, \nribbons, yarn wigs, or other such features are generally not appropriate. As they approach 8 \nmonths, children start to recognize words that are repeated. Such word recognition ability makes \ndolls and stuffed toys that say single words or a set of single words most attractive to those \nchildren. They also begin to recognize and become attracted to characters from familiar media, \nlike books and television.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"BUILDING PLAY: INTERLOCKING BUILDING MATERIALS"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#124","text":"toys that say single words or a set of single words most attractive to those \nchildren.

They can most easily handle dolls and stuffed toys that weigh up to 3 \nto 6 ounces and are within 8- to 12-inches in length.

During this period, children start \n\nPretend & Role Play: Dolls & Stuffed Toys \n85 \nto engage actively in imitative play with dolls and stuffed toys based on familiar family \nrelationships like mother and baby, or from watching television and other media. They are \nattracted to mid-size (10 to 16 inches) dolls and stuffed animals that offer simple cause-and-\neffect functions, such as push buttons that produce simple sounds or phrases, lights, and actions. \nFor the same reasons, children in this age group like manipulating extremities or heads to create \ndifferent postures and looks. \nBecause young children have a low degree of fine motor dexterity and control, dolls and stuffed \ntoys are best when they are easy to grip (for example, limbs ½ inch thick) and weigh no more \nthan 4 to 8 ounces.

Suitable dolls tend to have only molded hair, if any, and stuffed \nanimals lack fur. \n19 Through 23 Months \nChildren at this age still imitate a great deal, basing such play mostly on familiar domestic and \nmedia themes. They are attracted to dolls and stuffed toys that have a low-to-moderate level of \ncause-and-effect functionality. For example, they enjoy pushing buttons or areas on a doll or \nstuffed toy to produce combinations of sound, lights, or action. They like to make simple \nmanipulations of extremities or heads, and create different postures and looks (see also the \nExploratory and Practice Play category). They can appreciate a low-to-moderate level of \nrealistic detail and rich vibrant colors. Vinyl or rubber dolls with simple accessories, like a toy \nbaby bottle or blanket are appropriate. At this age, children have the gross motor skills needed to \nstand and push strollers, and have also cognitively reached a stage where they can pretend to take \ndolls and stuffed animals on “walks” using the stroller.

Children in this age \ngroup also enjoy playing with small peg dolls (see Pretend & Role Play: Play Scenes & \nPuppets). \n2 Years \nAlthough they still imitate a great deal, children in this age group increasingly recognize the \nsymbolic connections between toys and the real world, and they start to pretend more often than \nyounger children. This pretend play also occurs in more complex ways. Children in this age \ngroup have a low-to-moderate degree of fine motor dexterity and control and can handle slightly \nlarger (12 to 18 inches) and heavier (8 to 16 ounces) dolls and stuffed toys. Soft, rounded, \npliable, and cuddly dolls and stuffed toys are most attractive. Pale or pastel colors also begin to \nattract this age group. Dolls and stuffed toys may have a small number (about two to four) of \nfamiliar toy accessories,  such as a pet carrier, bone, blanket, stroller, or baby bottle. Children will \nalso pretend to feed a doll with a baby bottle at this age. Bottles with faux liquid inside, which \ndisappears when flipped over, may be introduced to this age group due to children’s familiarity \nwith baby bottles.  \nAppropriate dolls and stuffed toys are easily carried, non-threatening, and familiar-looking with \na friendly appearance.

Single, \npredictable interactions with talking dolls and stuffed toys activated by a button press begin to \nfoster a sense of control and mastery, especially if they are associated with familiar characters \nthe child recognizes from various media, books, or family and everyday contexts. Familiarity and \ncaptivating cause-and-effect features can help to balance out less cuddly forms, dull colors, and \nother less desirable features. Interactive or talking toys that require sequential actions to use them \nare less appealing. Additionally, any sound that is too loud, sudden, or extreme could cause the \nchild to avoid the toy.  \nBecause they desire independent functioning, children of this age enjoy dolls and stuffed toys \nthat are easy to take care of and dress; so those with simple hats or with vests that have large arm \nholes would be appropriate. Children in this age group also enjoy toys with usable pockets or \nones with easy-to-use pull strings and push buttons that initiate various actions. Two-year-olds \ncan remove clothing, but may have difficulty redressing, if clothing uses buttons or snaps. \nFasteners that are more easily usable by children in this age group include large buttons, hooks, \nand hook-and-loop or touch fasteners. They like simple dress-me dolls (with easy to remove \nclothing) and will pretend to bathe dolls, especially ones that are washable and submersible. \nSmaller dolls, as well as life-sized dolls, and accessories (e.g., baby dolls with grooming \nsupplies) also appeal to this age group, as do wooden or plastic peg dolls.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"BUILDING PLAY: INTERLOCKING BUILDING MATERIALS"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#129","text":"are washable and submersible. \nSmaller dolls, as well as life-sized dolls, and accessories (e.g., baby dolls with grooming \nsupplies) also appeal to this age group, as do wooden or plastic peg dolls.

\nand role-play as they construct dramatic scenes and stories. Children about 12 months of age \nmay enjoy plush animal puppets that are also used as stuffed animals, although this is not \nconsidered true puppet play. Until children reach about 19 months of age, adults may model play \nwith puppets or play scenes. At 19 months, children develop a greater capacity for making the \nsymbolic connections that support pretend play, and they start to engage in simple pretend \nactivities with play scenes and puppets. Preschool is the time of peak interest in play scenes and \npuppets. School-age children enjoy more diverse and complex play scenes and puppetry. Play \nscenes include miniature models, play sets, dollhouses, and pop-up scenes, all of which may \ncome with characters, small vehicles, props, or a variety of accessories. Puppets start off as \nsimple sock-like designs and evolve into elaborate hand puppets and marionettes, which may be \nused in conjunction with stages and scenery. \nOne should place primary emphasis or importance on the following characteristics when \ndetermining the age appropriateness of play scenes and puppets: \n• Motor Skills Required \n• Level of Realism/Detail \n• Interlocking/Loose Parts  \nThe order of the above characteristics does not necessarily indicate priority because this can \nchange with age. The remaining discussion describes the relationship between the characteristics \nof these toys and the characteristics of children in various age groups. This includes a description \nof what types of play scenes and puppets are appropriate and how a particular age group plays \nwith these toys. \n12 Through 18 Months \nThis age group may use a soft plush animal puppet, like a stuffed animal: cuddling and carrying \nit. They may also explore short, simple, sock-like puppets.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"PLAY SCENES & PUPPETS"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#145","text":"ys \nwith these toys. \n12 Through 18 Months \nThis age group may use a soft plush animal puppet, like a stuffed animal: cuddling and carrying \nit. They may also explore short, simple, sock-like puppets. Sizes tend to range from 8 to 12 \ninches, and they typically weigh 4 to 8 ounces. Puppets that portray familiar characters or have \n\nPretend & Role Play: Play Scene & Puppets \n100 \nsimple detail and contrasting facial features—especially eyes—are appealing to children in this \nage group. The openings should be large enough for easy hand access. Because this age has only \nlimited dexterity and fine motor control, puppets with arms or long hand/arm puppets are not \nappropriate, and will not be suitable until the child is about 3 years old. Although children in this \nage group are not yet ready for true pretend play with objects, they may enjoy handling and \ncarrying around small people and animals, or putting people into cars. As with puppets, these \nsmall figures need not be minutely detailed. \n19 Through 23 Months \nAt 19 months, children start to have enough fine motor control and cognitive ability to \nmanipulate simple sock-puppets and play scenes, as well as large accessories (2 to 4 inches), as \nthey conduct simple pretend play. They begin to enjoy simple, realistic (though not detailed), \nfamiliar play sets and miniature models with easy access to one or two large areas with about \ntwo to six people, animals, vehicles, or accessories. Examples include simple kitchens, farms, \ngas stations, airplanes, pop-up scenes like fire trucks, and play sets that have vehicles with small \nfigures like peg people. Although children in this age group do not need the small figures to have \nmoving parts or elaborate detail, they do prefer ones with salient features, such as painted faces, \nplastic hair, or hats. Children in this age group are more capable of carrying play scenes that are \nconstructed from lightweight plastic or wood, and that weigh 8 to 12 ounces.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"PLAY SCENES & PUPPETS"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#146","text":"uch as painted faces, \nplastic hair, or hats.

They are attracted to simple moving parts, like cranks or doors that they can slide \nor open via hinges with a basic pincer grip. \nAs they approach 3 years, children become attracted to simple sock and mitten puppets in which \noperation of the mouth encourages opening and closing with the thumb opposing the four \n\nPretend & Role Play: Play Scene & Puppets \n101 \nfingers. Openings at the base of the puppet should permit entry of their fist. They also begin to \nenjoy finger puppets as they practice fine motor control. \n3 Years \nMost 3-year-olds are primed for exploring and pretending with play scenes and puppets. They \nare much more adept than 2-year-olds at making symbolic connections and working with their \nfingers and hands. They prefer play scenes and puppets of moderate complexity and realistic \ndetail. They enjoy dollhouses and other familiar play scenes that have easy access to a few large \nareas with about a dozen loose parts that are easily positioned and repositioned. They also enjoy \nsmall playhouses or pop-up scenes where they can step in and take charge of their pretend \nepisodes. \nThree-year-olds use sock, mitten, hand, arm, and finger puppets for pretend play more than 2-\nyear-olds do.

They enjoy elaborate dollhouses with miniature figures and animals so \nthey can incorporate familiar themes (e.g., home or outer space) into their more structured, goal-\noriented dramatic play. This age group develops a keen awareness of licensed characters and \ncollectibles. They exhibit a moderate-to-high level of dexterity and fine motor skills as they \nmanipulate a wide variety of accessories of mostly smaller sizes. Although their interest in \nplayhouses subsides during this period, they still occasionally like the larger, more realistically \ndetailed and functional ones. \nChildren in this age group enjoy operating puppets that are more complex and jointed, and ones \nthat have hard heads and painted faces. They are attracted to puppets that have a high degree of \nrealistic detail, function, and elaborate costumes, accessories, or scenery. They now can start \nmanipulating simple string puppets or marionettes. At this age, children are able to master the \nuse of puppets, where one hand controls the mouth, and the other controls a rod that manipulates \nthe puppet’s arm.

\nDRESS-UP MATERIALS \nDress-up materials include costumes, accessories, jewelry, and dress-up kits that appeal to \nchildren of all ages, except infants. These materials also include related crafts, such as jewelry-\nmaking, bead-stringing, weaving, and braiding kits. As children develop greater cognitive \nawareness and manual dexterity, they can use dress-up materials in more sophisticated ways of \npretending. They use experiences with various media (primarily television, videos, computers, \nand books), family, and friends to perform imitatively or to live out fantasies of their own \nconstruction. \nOne should place primary emphasis or importance on the following characteristics when \ndetermining the age appropriateness of dress-up materials: \n• Level of Realism/Detail \n• Licensed theme \n• Materials \n• Motor Skills Required \nThe order of the above characteristics does not necessarily indicate priority because this can \nchange with age.

This includes a \ndescription of what types of dress-up materials are appropriate and how a particular age group \nplays with these products. \n12 Through 18 Months \nChildren around 12 months use very simple forms of imitation and pretend play with objects and \nothers, including imitation of adults and older peers. As they approach 18 months, they progress \ntoward more basic forms of pretend and imitation with dress-up materials in conjunction with \nlearning babbling and simple words. Although they do not pretend play much until they are \ncloser to 18 months, young children do begin to enjoy basic dress-ups and costumes like easy-to-\nput-on, one-piece bracelets and hair accessories. Although they may need help, older children in \n\nPretend & Role Play: Dress-Up Materials \n110 \nthis age group like easy-to-put-on, sleeveless, slip-on costumes without fasteners and with large \nopenings for arms and legs. \nChildren in this age group often enjoy putting on necklaces, but this can present a strangulation \nhazard. Therefore, suitable necklaces for this age group are designed so they let children easily \nput them on and take them off without posing a strangulation hazard (e.g.,  through the use of a \nbreak-away design). Children in this age group mouth objects and do not have the fine motor \nskills to use the materials in make-up kits or to use materials with sharp edges or points. \nAppropriate accessories have thick, rounded edges. \n19 Through 23 Months \nChildren 19 through 23 months of age become more aware that costumes and accessories are \nsymbolic for other characters, many of them licensed.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"PLAY SCENES & PUPPETS"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#155","text":"sories have thick, rounded edges. \n19 Through 23 Months \nChildren 19 through 23 months of age become more aware that costumes and accessories are \nsymbolic for other characters, many of them licensed. Around 19 months, the appeal of dress-up \nmaterials starts to increase along with the child’s increase in fine motor dexterity and control, \nsuch as the use of a pincer grasp between thumb and forefinger. They become more adept at \nundoing hook-and-loop or touch fasteners, though they still have some difficulty re-matching \nthese types of fasteners. They continue to enjoy the same materials as before, but they also enjoy \nlacing objects with simple purposes in mind, such as lacing cubes or boards with large holes or \nthick blunt spindles, wood or plastic materials, and braided or plastic string, and stringing large \nbeads (see also Media Play: Arts & Crafts). \nChildren in this age range are attracted to a variety of basic dress-up materials like shoes, hats, \nheadscarves, other hair accessories, snap-on ties, bracelets, and necklaces. They prefer a simple \nlevel of detail like basic non-elaborate shapes and rich, vibrant colors. They continue putting \nnecklaces and other items around their neck, so toys of this kind must not present a strangulation \nhazard.

They are learning to appreciate and enjoy \nthe symbolic transformations that dress-up materials allow like becoming mother or baby and \nplaying house. As they grow closer to 3 years of age, they have little difficulty becoming the \ncharacters that their costume suggests, acting out common behaviors and expressions of \ncharacters and pets, especially those from television and other media. They are developing \ngreater dexterity, and around 30 months of age they become more adept at matching hook-and-\nloop or touch fasteners, and using large buttons, buckles, or hooks as on frames and cubes. They \nenjoy independently putting on simple costumes (e.g., dresses, hats, and gloves) and accessories \nlike elastic bracelets and simple wigs. They also enjoy playing with dress-me dolls, lacing cards \nor shoes, and stringing beads. Handheld mirrors, especially those with a familiar fantasy theme \nlike princesses, appeal to children in this age group for role-playing purposes. Easy-to-put-on \njewelry, such as elastic bracelets and long necklaces that do not require the child to hook or latch \nthem and do not pose a strangulation hazard, are likely to appeal to this age. Earrings or short \nnecklaces that cannot be viewed by the child are of less interest. \n3 Years \nThree-year-olds look forward to pretending with costumes, accessories, and kits of moderately \nrealistic detail in rich, vibrant colors or pastel colors.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"PLAY SCENES & PUPPETS"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#157","text":"d by the child are of less interest. \n3 Years \nThree-year-olds look forward to pretending with costumes, accessories, and kits of moderately \nrealistic detail in rich, vibrant colors or pastel colors.

These have a basic understanding of the dynamics of good and evil, and begin \nto enjoy games like cops and robbers. They also enjoy other simple story lines that involve \nexploration, dinosaurs, pets, and family contexts. Three-year-old children are better able to \nremove a necklace from around their neck, but require large hooks or other fasteners that can be \neasily separated or undone. \n4 Through 5 Years \nThis age group demonstrates more expansive conceptualizations of symbolic meanings and \nmoderate problem-solving abilities. Children 4 and 5 years old develop greater sophistication in \ntheir pretend play and more often enact extended stories. They enjoy more elaborate, detailed \ncostumes (e.g., superheroes and identifiable professions), accessories (e.g., rings, earrings, \nbracelets, necklaces, wigs, hats, ties, and gloves), and kits (i.e., manicure, make-up, and disguise \nkits) that increase their opportunities for independently developing and extending more complex \ndramas and fantasies. Adult coaching helps children in this age group to extend their pretend \nplay. Their dexterity and fine motor skills are moderately developed to the point where they can \nhandle adult-size snaps, buttons, buckles, hooks, and lacing challenges better.

Appealing costumes, accessories, \nand kits are more realistic looking in size, detail, and function, and may include small beads for \nstringing jewelry, hand looms, hand sewing to make clothes for dolls and puppets, spool knitting, \nbraiding, and simple needlepoint.

Young children can be helped to develop their ability to imitate \nwith small vehicles by watching adults or older peers, although such modeling is not necessary \nfor children in this age group to play with these vehicles. Examples of small vehicle toys for this \nage group include small boats for the bathtub, simple cars, motorcycles, trucks, trains without \ntracks, and flying machines. Plastic, hard rubber, or lightweight wood are suitable materials for \nthese toys. \nChildren in this age group are mostly attracted to rich, vibrant colors with simple details that may \nbe realistic or fantasy-oriented in nature. Children in this age group enjoy small vehicle toys that \nare simple, easy to recognize, and of one-piece construction, although the wheels may spin. \nBecause children in this age group tend to mouth objects and demonstrate a low degree of fine \nmotor dexterity and control, appropriate small vehicles do not have removable or loose parts. \nYoung children also enjoy small vehicle toys with a low degree of cause and effect, such as \nvehicles on wheels that spin (see also Exploratory and Practice Play: Push & Pull Toys) or \nvehicles with push buttons that produce simple sounds, lights, and actions. Children in this age \ngroup can use small vehicle toys that are activated by shaking or that move after inserting a \ndriver figure into a seat.  Small vehicle toys for children in this age group are large enough for \neasy grasping and pushing (about 4 to 8 inches in size), and children find it easier to use these \ntoys if they have at least one section that fits a small pincer or full hand grip (about ¼ to ½ inch). \nThis, however, is not necessary.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"SMALL VEHICLE TOYS"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#169","text":"to 8 inches in size), and children find it easier to use these \ntoys if they have at least one section that fits a small pincer or full hand grip (about ¼ to ½ inch). \nThis, however, is not necessary. If the toy is to be picked up during use, children in this age \ngroup will find it easier to manipulate if it weighs no more than 3 ounces. Suitable toys have \nthick, rounded edges and are sturdy enough so the toy will not break or pull apart. \nSimple trains, constructed of molded plastic or wood, and capable of being rolled on either fixed \nor easy turning wheels, start to appeal to this age group. Because children in this age group have \ngreat difficulty negotiating tracks or manipulating and maintaining train or track connections, \ntrains with tracks or small coupling mechanisms are generally not appropriate. As children \napproach 18 months, they can use simple coupling devices like large hooks or magnets. \n\nPretend & Role Play: Small Vehicle Toys \n123 \n19 Through 23 Months \nAround 19 months of age, children begin very simple pretend play with small vehicle toys, \nmostly imitating domestic and predominant media themes, such as the family car, or popular \ncartoons that have vehicles. Children in this age group enjoy small vehicle toys that have a low-\nto-moderate level of cause-and-effect functionality, like pushing buttons to produce sounds, \nlights, or movements, or pulling on a cord. Children at this age enjoy small vehicles that are \nbattery operated and can perform simple tricks (e.g., tumbling, rotating, and bump-and-go \nmotions   when a button is pressed on them). At any younger age, children may not have the \ncognitive skills to move out of the way to allow the vehicle to pass and complete its action.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"SMALL VEHICLE TOYS"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#170","text":"d bump-and-go \nmotions   when a button is pressed on them). At any younger age, children may not have the \ncognitive skills to move out of the way to allow the vehicle to pass and complete its action. They \nenjoy relatively large, simple, workable parts—like hinged doors or hoods, dumpers, hoses, sails, \nrudders, ladders, and propellers—as long as they require only a low degree of fine motor \ndexterity and control and are easily manipulated with a pincer grasp. As steadier walking \ndevelops, they enjoy pulling small vehicles on a cord (see Exploratory and Practice Play: Push \n& Pull Toys). They find appealing small vehicles that have a low-to-moderate level of realistic \ndetail and rich vibrant colors. Suitable small vehicle toys for these children may include boats for \nthe bathtub, cars, motorcycles, fantasy vehicles, trucks, trains, and flying machines. On average, \nwind-up vehicles are not appropriate for these children. \nThese children begin simpler pretend play with small vehicle toys as they approach 2 years. \nVehicles should be washable or easily cleaned, and should be large enough for easy grasping, \ngripping, or pushing. Vehicles that are 6 to 12 inches are appropriate, as well as those that fit a \npincer or full hand grip. These toys typically weigh no more than 4 ounces if they are expected to \nbe picked up during use. For safety reasons, these toys should be of sturdy construction so that \nthey do not break or pull apart, and have thick, rounded edges. \nBoats, cars, motorcycles, fantasy vehicles, and trucks may have slightly more detail, although \nthis is not necessary to appeal to this age group. Trains appeal, but this age group can handle \ngreater challenges. As they approach 2 years, children in this age group are more adept at \npushing buttons, manipulating parts, and operating simple remote devices. As with trains for \nyounger children, tracks are not appropriate, but children in this age group do enjoy manipulating","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"SMALL VEHICLE TOYS"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#171","text":"pt at \npushing buttons, manipulating parts, and operating simple remote devices.

Two- \nto four-car trains appeal to this age group. \n2 Years \nChildren at age 2 start to pretend more often given their increased recognition of the symbolic \nconnections between toys and the real world. Such pretend play also occurs in more complex \nways than is the case with younger children. They are attracted to small vehicle toys that have a \nlow-to-moderate level of cause-and-effect functionality, as when their pushing produces sound, \nlights, or movement; when they pull vehicles on a cord; or when they use an intuitive remote \ncontrol with a couple large push buttons, or turn a steering wheel to produce basic actions. At \nthis age, children have the fine and gross motor skills to hold a remote control and press buttons \nsimultaneously; any younger age child may have difficulty combining these two actions. For \nmore pretend opportunities, children in this age group enjoy several movable parts, like doors, \nhoods, dumpers, hoses, sails, rudders, propellers, and simple levers that are large and simple for \neasy pincer grasp. They enjoy small vehicles with low-to-moderately realistic detail and rich \nvibrant colors or bright pastels. They also enjoy vehicles that require a low-to-moderate degree \nof fine motor dexterity and control, including boats in the bathtub, cars, motorcycles, trucks, \ntrains, fantasy vehicles, and flying machines. Children in this age group can soon use simple, \none- or two-turn,  wind-up mechanisms of low tension with a progressively higher rate of success \nas they progress towards 3 years of age. \nSmall vehicle toys may be smaller (2 to 4 inches), or larger (10 to 18 inches) for pushing \npurposes.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"SMALL VEHICLE TOYS"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#172","text":"low tension with a progressively higher rate of success \nas they progress towards 3 years of age. \nSmall vehicle toys may be smaller (2 to 4 inches), or larger (10 to 18 inches) for pushing \npurposes. As they approach 30 months of age, they are increasingly aware of vehicles featuring \nlicensed characters, which starts to play a role in their preferences and ultimate enjoyment of \nthese toys. They also start to enjoy small vehicles that incorporate the most basic educational \npurposes, such as a few voice-activated numbers and letters in tandem with relevant \nconfigurations. Children in this age group may find it difficult to manipulate toys that are not \neasily grasped or that weigh more than 4 to 6 ounces, if designed to be picked up during use (for \nexample, an airplane). Appropriate toys are constructed to prevent them from breaking or pulling \napart, and are typically made with thick, rounded edges. Washable or easy-to-clean toys are \ndesirable. \n\nPretend & Role Play: Small Vehicle Toys \n125 \nChildren in this age group enjoy large trucks with relatively large, simple working parts, handles, \nand wheels, because they can be used easily for more purposeful activities like carrying, \ndumping, or rescuing. Due to the larger size of these trucks, hard plastic is often preferred over \nmetal to keep the toys from getting too heavy. The same trains that are appropriate for younger \nchildren are also appropriate here, but their cars can be smaller,  and moving wheels are much \nmore appealing than fixed ones. As they approach 3 years, children in this age group enjoy \nconnecting simple hooking, snapping, or interlacing tracks with ample width for error as they \npush and pull a compatible car, train, or other vehicle along, or watch it go down a slope. They \nalso enjoy manipulating, and are more successful at connecting and maintaining, simple coupling \nmechanisms with multiple cars that easily fasten and detach.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"SMALL VEHICLE TOYS"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#173","text":"along, or watch it go down a slope.

They enjoy small \nvehicles that produce sounds or talking, lights, or movement by pushing buttons on the toy or on \na remote control to produce basic actions. Small vehicle toys are attractive to this age because \nthey are used increasingly in cooperative contexts that have a low-to moderate-level of social \ninteractions, especially as they approach age 4. Children in this age group are attracted to both \nsmaller (1 to 8 inches) and larger (12 to 24 inches) vehicles of more complexity and detail. They \nprefer vehicles in basic coordinated sets (e.g., miniature die-cast cars and vehicles approximately \n1:60 to 1:64 scale) and those with relevant figures and accessories. \n \nBoats, cars, motorcycles, fantasy vehicles, trucks, and flying machines begin to appeal to 3-year-\nolds when they are more detailed, so they are attracted to materials like die-cast metal or plastics \nthat capture more detail. They begin to prefer a moderate level of realistic detail like proportional \ndesign, loose parts, functionality, decorations, and printed words. They enjoy rich vibrant colors \nand bright pastel colors. They are attracted to simple remote devices that have easy to manipulate \nbuttons, joysticks, or handheld controllers.

They enjoy pretending with numerous movable parts, like doors, hoods, dumpers, \nhoses, sails, rudders, propellers, simple levers, with large workable parts for easy pincer grasp. \nSmall vehicles that feature licensed characters popularized by various media appeal to children \nin this age group. If the toy is designed to be picked up during use, lightweight vehicles (no more \nthan 6 to 8 ounces) are more appropriate. \nPreferred trains have multiple cars that fasten and detach. As with the previous age group, large \nsimple tracks with easy connections appeal to children in this age group because they derive a \nsense of completion and accomplishment when putting objects together. These children are \ncapable of aligning a die-cast car onto a compatible track, pulling on a lever to move the car up a \nhill, and watching it travel down a slope at a high rate of speed. Track sets with garages, lifts, \nlaunchers, ramps, or manual elevators that are compatible with die cast cars are appropriate. \n4 Through 5 Years \nChildren in this age group immensely enjoy small vehicle toys because they can incorporate \nthem into their moderately to highly complex pretend play. More complex small vehicles \npromote more complex and longer periods of pretend play. Because they develop richer \nsymbolic meanings than 3-year olds and have moderate problem-solving abilities, 4- and 5-year \nolds use small vehicle toys as aids or pivots for enacting diverse, often extended stories with a \nfriend or group.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"SMALL VEHICLE TOYS"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#175","text":"eanings than 3-year olds and have moderate problem-solving abilities, 4- and 5-year \nolds use small vehicle toys as aids or pivots for enacting diverse, often extended stories with a \nfriend or group. \nChildren in this age group enjoy rich, vibrant colors and more realistic colors, as well as a \nmoderate-to-high level of realistic detail, including proportional design, movable parts, \nfunctionality, and more detailed decorations or wording.

They enjoy medium-\nto-small   -size keys on low-to-medium tension wind-up toys. They are attracted to familiar small \nvehicles that feature licensed characters popularized by various media, and those that come with \nremovable characters. This is also the age at which children begin to develop an interest in \ncollectible vehicles. Appropriate small vehicles that are expected to be picked up during use, \ngenerally weigh no more than 10 ounces. Children in this age group prefer both smaller (1 to 12 \ninches) and larger (24 to 36 inches) vehicles, as well as numerous loose parts of all sizes. \nMore detailed and realistic trains are preferred. These trains have multiple cars that fasten and \ndetach, and large tracks with easy-to-hook-up, snap-on, or lock-type connections. They enjoy \nplaying with heavier trains that they can readily maneuver, or operating simple electric trains \nwith an adult. Children in this age also can manage track sets with dozens of interchangeable \npieces that can be used to perform stunts or race two or more die-cast cars. \n6 Through 8 Years \nThese school-age children are attracted to small vehicles that are highly realistic, minutely \ndetailed, highly functional, and unique in shape, parts, and color.

They prefer more complex, highly detailed flying machines that may have a \nsmall key for medium-tension wind ups. They have a keen interest in those small vehicles with \nage-appropriate licenses popularized by various media, including a somewhat sophisticated \ninterest in collectibles as they approach the end of this period.

pretend and role-play start to appeal to children about 12 months old. This is \nabout the time when they figure out that many objects can be used to imitate adults and older \npeers. Around 19 months, tools and props will help them to role-play domestic themes. By age 3, \nchildren are performing simple dramatic scenes and stories. Many of the simpler toys in this \nsubcategory may also be found in the Exploratory and Practice Play category, where children of \nyounger ages use such toys. \nOne should place primary emphasis or importance on the following characteristics when \ndetermining the age appropriateness of tools and props: \n• Cause & Effect \n• Size of Parts \n• Level of Realism/Detail \n• Color/Contrast \nThe order of the above characteristics does not necessarily indicate priority because this can \nchange with age. The remaining discussion describes the relationship between the characteristics \nof these toys and the characteristics of children in various age groups. This includes a description \nof what types of tools and props are appropriate and how a particular age group plays with these \ntoys. \n12 Through 18 Months \nAlthough young children do not make clear symbolic connections until they are closer to 18 \nmonths, children about 12 months of age will start to actively engage in imitative play with \nsimple and chunky-shaped substitutes of objects they see adults and older peers using. For \nexample, regardless of whether realistic detail is present, young children hold toy telephones \n(wired and cellular) to their ear because they often see their elders do so.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"SMALL VEHICLE TOYS"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#187","text":"and older peers using. For \nexample, regardless of whether realistic detail is present, young children hold toy telephones \n(wired and cellular) to their ear because they often see their elders do so. Soon they begin to \nimitate a phone conversation with babbling and later with words. Children will spend a fair \namount of their time repeatedly pressing buttons on a simple toy telephone (including those with \nfake touchscreen square “app” buttons), camera, remote, or other interactive props, such as a \n\nPretend & Role Play: Tools & Props \n136 \nteapot, or small vacuum,  to hear the electronic sounds it produces. They like the cause-and-effect \nstimuli from pushing buttons and making sounds (see also Exploratory and Practice Play). \nAn imitative response is starting to emerge with other tools and props that they have seen adults \nperform around the house (e.g., drinking, talking on the phone). They can use sets with up to six \nseparate parts. Rounded toys that are constructed from cleanable, thick, and sturdy materials and \nstructure—so children cannot break or pull them apart—are appropriate. They also prefer toys \nwith rich, vibrant colors. These toys are easier to use if they fit the child’s small opposable grip \nor full hand grip (handles about ½-inch thick) and weigh no more than 3 ounces if expected to be \npicked up by the child during play. Other examples of toys appropriate for 12- through 18-month \nolds, in roughly the same order as they would be purchased as the child matures through this \nperiod, include rakes, shovels and trowels, and buckets. \n19 Through 23 Months \nChildren 19 through 23 months old are becoming more aware that tools and props represent \nother objects. A symbolic response may be seen with tools and props, such as kitchen toys and \ndishes, a teapot with cups and saucers, toy house-cleaning tools (e.g.,  brooms, mops, dustpans, \nand carpet sweepers), and lawnmower-like toys. Adults may encourage these actions to stimulate \npretend play.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"SMALL VEHICLE TOYS"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#188","text":"a teapot with cups and saucers, toy house-cleaning tools (e.g.,  brooms, mops, dustpans, \nand carpet sweepers), and lawnmower-like toys.

They enjoy cellular phones that are modeled after those with \ntraditional buttons and will continue to use those with fake touchscreen square “app” buttons. \nThese children can use toy cameras during pretend-play episodes (e.g., holding up to eye and \npretending to take a picture).  \nChildren in this age group are just learning to push wheeled tools and props, such as a toy \nvacuum, while standing. Care should be taken to ensure that these props are lightweight, and in \nthe case of lawnmowers and vacuums, easy to balance.

Appropriate \ntools and props have a low level of realistic detail, rich, vibrant colors, thick and rounded edges, \nand require only a low degree of fine motor dexterity and control. \n2 Years \nTwo-year-olds start to pretend more often because they increasingly recognize the symbolic \nconnections between role-play and the real world. This pretend play is more frequent and occurs \nin more complex ways than with younger children. Children in this age group are attracted to the \nsame tools and props as 19-23-month olds, but they should have a level of cause and effect that \nresponds to the child’s actions in a simple way that is conducive to their limited motor and \ncognitive skills (i.e., button pressing continues to be appropriate at this age), be a bit more \nrealistic (still somewhat cartoonish instead of very realistic) in detail, have rich, vibrant colors, \nand require a moderate degree of fine motor dexterity and control. Children in this age group can \nalso readily incorporate into their pretend play, a simple light-up wand that is short and \nlightweight, as well as all tools and props for younger children. Tools and props that come in sets \nand tend to have no more than 10 pieces are appropriate. \nAs children grow closer to 3 years, they get better at substituting less realistic items for tools and \nprops, and they can handle slightly bigger and heavier (8 ounces or ½ pound) tools and props. \nSuitable toys for older children are made of thick, sturdy, cleanable, rounded material and \nstructure so children cannot break or pull them apart.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"SMALL VEHICLE TOYS"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#190","text":"and heavier (8 ounces or ½ pound) tools and props. \nSuitable toys for older children are made of thick, sturdy, cleanable, rounded material and \nstructure so children cannot break or pull them apart. \n3 Years \nThree-year-olds have a moderate degree of dexterity, fine motor control, and ability to pretend. \nThey enjoy using moderately to highly detailed, realistic looking, and slightly fragile tools. \nLightweight (no more than 8 ounces) props permit easier manipulations.

Such toys are \nincreasingly used in cooperative contexts, especially as they get closer to 4 years old. Children in \nthis age group, because of their newly acquired level of speech and their desire to be more social \nand cooperative, are very attracted to telephones and mobile communication devices that have \nbright colors with moderately realistic details and somewhat complex functionality.

These include props like cash registers and play money, medical kits, \nkitchen/cooking sets, cameras, telephones, mobile communication devices, toy guns, holsters, \nhelmets, low-power water guns that have a moderate degree of realistic detail, and small bow \nand arrow sets whose arrows are tipped with suction-cups. Sets of tools and props typically have \nno more than 10 pieces. \nTools and props designed for more complex cause and effect appear to promote more complex \nand longer periods of pretend play. For example, 4- and 5-year olds seek realistic detail and \nprefer telephones and mobile communication devices with different buttons that produce various \nrealistic functions. For example, the phone may beep and have a dial tone, voice response, or text \nmessaging. Children in this age group do not prefer fantasy functions, like songs that play, as \nmuch as they did when they were younger. Cameras with a viewfinder function (such as a \nkaleidoscope lens) can also be used at this age because children know to hold it to their eye, peek \nthrough a viewfinder hole, and push down a pretend button. Looking through a viewfinder and \npointing out objects is appealing.  At younger ages, children lack the cognitive skills to \nunderstand which side of the camera is the proper side to look through. \n6 Through 8 Years \nYoung school-age children produce fewer pretend episodes than pre-school children as they \ndelve into more structured games.

Puzzle play can be a solitary or group \nactivity. Puzzles are often seen as a solitary activity for young children; however,  children are \nalso keen observers and interested in watching others finish puzzles. In general, puzzles are \nappropriate for children starting at 12 months of age. Children younger than this can only use \npre-puzzles, which are meant for exploratory or practice play,  rather than fitting pieces together. \nTherefore, these are considered under Exploratory and Practice Play: Mirrors, Mobiles, & \nManipulatives. \nPuzzles require three major skills: fine motor skill to pick up and place the pieces, visual \ndiscrimination to identify if the pieces fit, and some cognitive skill to organize and plan the \nplacing of pieces. As children develop, their fine motor skills increase, visual discrimination \nimproves, and cognitive abilities for trying different puzzle strategies improve. Children who \nhave more experience with puzzles can try more complex puzzles at an earlier age than children \nwho have little experience. Puzzles are important for the problem-solving process, because \nchildren learn new strategies for completing puzzles as they try new puzzles. Research indicates \nthat working with puzzles and other closed-ended materials encourages persistence in children \nbecause they are expecting a solution for fitting the pieces together.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"SMALL VEHICLE TOYS"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#203","text":"y new puzzles.

They can rarely \nfocus on the visual discrimination cues required to finish a puzzle. Puzzles with simple frames, \nlarge pieces with easy to grip knobs, and large distinctly shaped wells that can accommodate a \nfew shapes, animals, or vehicles may be introduced to this age group, but these children are still \nprimarily focusing on sensory-motor experiences so they approach puzzles by grasping them, \nmouthing them, banging them, and throwing the pieces.  \n19 Through 23 Months \nNineteen-month-old children are interested in putting together objects that fit.

For example, frames that have individual \nplaces for each piece can be used. Knobs on the puzzles allow the child to rotate the puzzle piece \nin place without having to move their fingers. Appropriate inset puzzles have individual pieces \nwith distinctive shapes to emphasize visual cues. Puzzle pieces with smooth edges that are made \nfrom wood or another lightweight material like plastic are suitable. \n3 Years \nThree-year-olds have developed greater fine motor skill and visual discrimination. Although they \nhave greater physical dexterity, they may still require knobs on the puzzle pieces and an inset \nform or frame for placing them. If there are no knobs, a magnetic connection between the puzzle \npiece and a magnetic wand to pick up the piece (e.g., a fishing puzzle) will suffice. At age 3, \nchildren’s fine motor skills are developed enough to align the magnetic wand with the metal in \nthe puzzle piece to grab and maneuver the puzzle piece to where it belongs. Younger age groups \nmay have trouble aligning the two magnets with enough precision to complete the puzzle. Three-\nyear olds are interested in licensed characters based on popular age-appropriate cartoons or \ntelevision characters; so pictures of common objects and licensed characters are appropriate for \nthis age. Parents prefer characters that are non-violent or non-threatening (also known as “safe \nharbor characters”), and these may come from popular cartoons or children’s books. Because of \ntheir greater cognitive ability, 3-year olds can work puzzles with up to 26 pieces. Cardboard \npuzzles may be introduced to children in this age group because they are less likely to mouth the \npieces and thus ruin the fit.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"SMALL VEHICLE TOYS"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#206","text":"ability, 3-year olds can work puzzles with up to 26 pieces.

Because games are \nsocial in nature, they are very appealing to children. Games also appeal to children because they \nhave a cognitive element, and give children an opportunity to interact with and learn from adults. \nInfants and toddlers, however, have not developed the cognitive and motor skills required to take \npart in structured games. Although they enjoy participating in social situations, 2-year-olds \ncannot focus on game rules. \nThe games covered under this category include card games, lotto and bingo games, dominoes, \ndice games, floor games, table games, and similar games. Games come in great varieties and \nhave a number of different permutations. By definition, games have a number of rules that \nregulate how the players are expected to participate. Games may have different methods of \ntaking turns, and are based on randomness, strategy, or a combination of the two. Parents like \ngames because they can directly or indirectly teach cognitive and academic skills. Parents also \nlike traditional or classic board games because they enjoyed them as children. \nOne should place primary emphasis or importance on the following characteristics when \ndetermining the age appropriateness of card, floor, board, and table games: \n• Motor Skills Required \n• Content Complexity \n• Length of Time Required to Play \n• Educational \n• Classic \nThe order of the above characteristics does not necessarily indicate priority because this can \nchange with age.

Instead, children in this age group \nwill often use games of this sort as learning or educational toys (see Technology Play: Learning \nProducts and Smart Toys & Educational Software). Simple matching or lotto-type games, in \nwhich the matching is based on pictures, shapes, or colors, rather than more abstract letters or \nnumbers, may be enjoyed by children in the latter half of this age group. Dominoes—especially \ngiant ones—also may be enjoyed by children in this age group. Based on observational data, \nalthough 2-year-olds are attracted to magnetic fishing games, most do not possess adequate fine-\nmotor skills to be successful. These children may enjoy simple action games that involve \npressing a lever or flipping a marker into a hole. Play with these games may involve one other \nchild or adult, but children of this age will often choose to play with the game alone in \nexploratory ways. \n3 Years \nGames for 3-year-olds must be very simple, with no more than five or six pieces involved, and \ninvolve few rules. Three-year-olds can take turns and understand simple rules. They can follow a \nplan of action by moving a piece from start to finish. Although 3-year-olds can concentrate on a \ngame, games for 3-year-olds should move quickly and not require too much time between turns.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"SMALL VEHICLE TOYS"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#213","text":"follow a \nplan of action by moving a piece from start to finish.

They enjoy \nmatching and memory games that require them to follow a set of actions in a pattern. For \nexample, children in this age group now have the memory skills to flip over an object with a \nshape on it, turn it back over, and be able to relocate the shape. Appropriate card games require \nonly simple matching and do not require children to hold cards in their hands. \n4 Through 5 Years \nChildren 4 through 5 years old have a greater interest in games, but they still lack the ability to \nunderstand complex rules and strategies. Although most 4- and 5-year-olds are developing their \nreading abilities, they generally cannot use written directions. Words and numbers can be used as \npart of the game, if they are not needed for complex actions.

They can anticipate moves and focus on more than \none rule at the same time. They can remember a number of moves and can use reading as part of \nthe activity. In addition, light and sound pattern pads are usable by children at this age, because \nthey have the cognitive skills to follow a pattern for multiple steps in sequence. When given a \nlight and sound pattern pad, children at younger ages are unable to wait for the prompts, and they \nkeep pressing the buttons without regard to the pattern.

Ride-on toys are very popular with children, who enjoy \nboth the sense of movement that they get from wheeled toys and the pretend element that \nwheeled toys give them as they imitate the important adults in their lives. Ride-on toys are \nimportant for developing a sense of balance, physical fitness, and coordination. The ride-on toys \ncovered under this category include sit-on riders, motorized vehicles, bicycles, skateboards, \nscooters and tricycles, and rocker toys. \nSeveral physical factors determine the age level for using ride-on toys. The first factor is balance. \nDepending on the vehicle, more or less balance is required to use the vehicle. In general, wide-\nspaced wheels and more wheels make the vehicle easier to balance. The second factor is the \nrotational speed of the wheels. Wheels that turn very easily can move faster, and speed of \nmovement increases the difficulty level. The final factor is the method of propulsion. A wheeled \nvehicle that relies on children pushing with their feet will move slowest, while wheeled vehicles \npropelled by pedaling, or that use gears can attain greater speeds. Motorized vehicles can be set \nat different speeds, with increased speed requiring greater physical skill. Children\n under the age \nof 1 year cannot use ride-on toys because they require a sense of balance to operate. The balance \nthat is required to use a ride-on toy usually develops when a child begins to walk with some \nsteadiness. In general, ride-on toys are not recommended for use without proper protective gear, \nespecially helmets.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"SMALL VEHICLE TOYS"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#225","text":"uired to use a ride-on toy usually develops when a child begins to walk with some \nsteadiness.

The remaining discussion describes the relationship between the characteristics \n\nSports, Recreational, & Outdoor Play: Ride-On Toys \n172 \nof these toys and the characteristics of children in various age groups. This includes a description \nof what types of ride-on toys are appropriate and how a particular age group plays with these \ntoys. \n12 Through 18 Months \nChildren become capable of using ride-on toys that are straddled and propelled by their feet only \nafter they learn to walk with some steadiness. Children in this age group, especially the youngest \nin this age group, may not be able to alternate their feet when pushing ride-on toys. They cannot \nyet pedal, and instead, they will propel the ride-on toy by pushing with both feet simultaneously. \nFor safety reasons, ride-on toys must be stable, and vehicles with four or more wheels tend to be \nmore stable than three- or two-wheeled vehicles. For this age group, appropriate ride-on toys \nhave wheels that are spaced relatively wide apart to be stable, but not so wide apart that it is \ndifficult for children to swing their legs over the seat. The toy should be low for easy mounting \nand dismounting, and the children’s feet should be flat on the floor when they are seated. \nFor maneuverability, recessed wheels make it easier for the child to push herself or himself along \nwithout banging their feet or legs into the wheels. Castors or wheels are appropriate.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"SMALL VEHICLE TOYS"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#226","text":"are seated. \nFor maneuverability, recessed wheels make it easier for the child to push herself or himself along \nwithout banging their feet or legs into the wheels. Castors or wheels are appropriate. For the \nyoungest children in this age group, castors may be preferable, because they allow the toy to \nmove in any direction without tipping. A child’s first ride-on toys does not need to have steering \nmechanisms because young children may not be able to use them effectively. Simple rocking \nhorses may be introduced. Suitable rocking horses are small and mounted and dismounted easily \nto reduce the risk of falling. Children’s feet should touch the floor or the base of the horse when \nthey are seated, and the horse should have a confined rocking arc. \n19 Through 23 Months \nChildren 19 through 23 months old can operate ride-on toys in which they sit inside and propel \nthe toy by pushing with their feet. However, these are more difficult to use than the straddle ride-\non toys because they are harder to steer and maneuver. Features that make ride-on toys more \nattractive to children include bright colors, special sound effects, like beeping horns, or noises \nproduced by vehicle movement, and that come with covered compartments or storage bins.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"SMALL VEHICLE TOYS"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#227","text":"n toys more \nattractive to children include bright colors, special sound effects, like beeping horns, or noises \nproduced by vehicle movement, and that come with covered compartments or storage bins. \n\nSports, Recreational, & Outdoor Play: Ride-On Toys \n173 \nChildren at this age are interested in cause-and-effect actions that produce sounds or reveal \nhidden items. Children in this age group are also interested in carrying and collecting items that \nthey can put in storage bins or compartments. Wagons are appropriate. Suitable rocking horses \nare small and easily mounted to reduce the risk of falling. Children’s feet should touch the floor \nor the base of the horse when they are seated, and the horse should have a confined rocking arc. \nFeatures that make rocking horses popular include their realistic or nostalgic (like those popular \nfor previous generations of children) appearance, and their ability to make sounds. With adult \nsupervision, some children may be capable of making a slow-moving motorized vehicle stop and \ngo; but children in this age group are unlikely to have the steering skills needed to avoid \nobstacles and hazards. \n2 Years \nChildren 2 years old enjoy the same characteristics and features of ride-on toys as younger \nchildren. Pretend play begins to appear around this age, so vehicles that are realistic, like pretend \nfire engines, are popular. Parents are also interested in encouraging pretend play and are very \nlikely to buy realistic-looking vehicles for this age group. Children of this age group have \nincreased coordination and balance, so they can maneuver a ride-on toy that requires them to \nbounce up and down in the seat. Slow-moving, three-wheeled scooters with wide standing \nplatforms also become attractive to children in this age group.

Tricycles should be sized to the \n\nSports, Recreational, & Outdoor Play: Ride-On Toys \n174 \nchild, and 12- or 13-inch wheels are about the right size for children in this age group.

Children at age 3 can steer a slow-moving, battery-\noperated vehicle. \n4 Through 5 Years \nChildren 4 and 5 years old are interested in vehicles used by older peers. They have little interest \nin the types of ride-on toys that are commonly used by younger children, and prefer the bicycles \nand scooters used by older peers.

Appropriate playground \nequipment has rounded edges and is free of protrusions. Loose ropes and straps can form a noose \naround the child’s neck, and therefore, present a risk of strangulation. Around 2 years of age, \nchildren start to take an interest in creative movement activities. They enjoy moving to music, \nrepeating song lyrics, and participating in finger games. Materials for creative movement at this \nage are generally limited to parachutes, played under adult supervision, in which children pull \nthe parachute back and forth and up and down to create waves and sounds.

\n\nMedia Play \n209 \nARTS & CRAFTS \nArts and crafts are an integral part of children’s total development. Nourishing the creative and \nexpressive self is important to instilling self-assurance and enhancing both creative thinking and \nproblem solving. This can be accomplished through activities in which the child can work with \ndifferent types of artistic media and materials. Arts and crafts are generally not appropriate until \nabout the age of 12 months. Beginning in toddlerhood, many children are given opportunities for \nfree expression through art materials. Crafts play an important part in learning skills that are \nmore work related, such as sewing, knitting, block printing, bookbinding, and doll making. \nOne should place primary emphasis or importance on the following characteristics when \ndetermining the age appropriateness of arts and crafts: \n• Cause & Effect \n• Sensory Elements \n• Size of Parts \n• Color/Contrast \nThe order of the above characteristics does not necessarily indicate priority because this can \nchange with age. The remaining discussion describes the relationship between the characteristics \nof these products and the characteristics of children in various age groups. This includes a \ndescription of what types of arts and crafts are appropriate and how a particular age group plays \nwith these media. \n8 Through 11 Months \nFrom 8 through 11 months of age, infants become more mobile and their behaviors become more \ncoordinated and outwardly initiated. Because of this increase in physical and cognitive \ndevelopment, infants around this age are beginning to understand simple cause-and-effect \nrelationships. This makes art materials somewhat attractive for children of this age, but only in a \nfunctional/exploratory way.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"MEDIA PLAY"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#262","text":"ts around this age are beginning to understand simple cause-and-effect \nrelationships.

However, these children do not generally draw or \n\nMedia Play: Arts & Crafts \n210 \nscribble until they reach 1 year old. Since children of this age have a propensity for exploring \nobjects orally, paints are not recommended. \n12 Through 18 Months \nChildren from 12 through 18 months of age are increasingly curious and love to explore, traits \nthat are facilitated by their increasing walking skills. They have increasingly good balance at this \nage, and may begin making marks on the wall or an easel. They are working on fine motor \ncoordination and can perform many manual functions, including controlled grasping and \nreleasing. They may even exhibit a preference for a dominant hand at close to 18 months of age. \nThey are even exploring the world more expansively through all their senses: seeing, hearing, \ntouching, tasting, and smelling. They are still interacting with the art materials in a \nfunctional/exploratory way and have very short attention spans. They scribble either by imitation \nor spontaneously, and can make circular marks. \nSuitable materials are appropriately sized to children’s grips, and are lightweight but sturdy. \nLarge easy-to-grip crayons and markers are appropriate for children in this age group, and large \nsheets of art and construction paper are best. Crayons in the shape of spheres, and markers in the \nshape of chunky animals, are easy for children to grip at this age. At this age, children’s fine \nmotor skills are rudimentary, but they are able to scribble with these chunky writing utensils, \ninstead of playing with crayons and markers as manipulative play objects as they might at \nyounger ages.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"MEDIA PLAY"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#263","text":"otor skills are rudimentary, but they are able to scribble with these chunky writing utensils, \ninstead of playing with crayons and markers as manipulative play objects as they might at \nyounger ages.

Children can also hold tablets in \ntheir lap that have gel or particles inside, and they can make marks or other designs with their \nfinger because t his only requires limited fine motor skills. \n19 Through 23 Months \nRepresentational and symbolic thinking emerges between 19 and 23 months; however, \nrepresentational art is only in its infancy, even as they approach 2 years of age. Although their \ndrawings look nonrepresentational and are not recognized as representational by adults, they \nrepresent something to children in this age group. By 2 years of age, some can draw simple \n\nMedia Play: Arts & Crafts \n211 \nangles. The fine motor movements of children in this age group are becoming more skillful. \nTheir behaviors are goal-directed, and they like to experiment. Art, in general, and scribbling, in \nparticular, provides them with a non-verbal means of expression. Furthermore, scribbling assists \nchildren in developing muscle control, which is needed for the next stage of development. \nSuitable materials are appropriately sized to children’s grips, and are lightweight but sturdy. \nLarge easy-to-grip crayons and markers are appropriate for children in this age group, and large \nsheets of art and construction paper are best.

The range of art materials available to them greatly \nincreases because of cognitive and physical developments, although they may still put objects in \ntheir mouth. They also love the texture of materials and will use their hands to handle materials \nwhenever possible. They love to finger paint. Use of non-toxic and washable, or mess-free finger \npaint (i.e., clear gel that activates special paper), is appropriate at this age. Children are \nbeginning to use a chunky stylus to make marks or designs on a tablet with gel or black particles \ninside. They can make color distinctions, move fingers independently of each other, and may be \nbeginning to cut with blunt-end scissors. They can scribble, draw circular marks, some vertical \nlines, copy circles,  and crosses.

Some children will choose easels for artwork. They \ncan use blunt-end scissors and string large beads, and finger painting is also a popular art \nactivity. Finally, although children at this age are too young to use conventional stickers (they \nmay get put in the mouth and require dexterity to use), children can use pre-gummed sticker pads \nand attach large, easy-to-grip items to them. \n3 Years \nChildren 3 years of age refer to the symbolic aspects of their art when they talk about their art. \nThey will make the same shapes and scribbles repeatedly, practicing and exploring through art. \nThey are highly attracted by art materials that produce interesting effects and are tactually \nstimulating. They are less likely to mouth art and craft materials, making scented materials more \nappropriate. They are learning to handle scissors and glue, and their fine motor control continues \nto improve.

Fine motor skills at this age allow \nchildren to maneuver both knobs at the same time. Magnetic drawing boards (black and white or \ncolor) with a thin diameter stylus and a few stamps in common shapes (e.g., triangle, square, and \ncircle) are appropriate for this age group. \n4 Through 5 Years \nAt 4 and 5 years of age, children’s art starts to resemble what it is meant to represent. Four-year-\nolds can add as many as seven parts to the outline of a human figure. They can string small beads \nand can copy bead order when stringing beads. They can cut along a line with scissors, and can \ncopy squares, divided rectangles, ladder designs, letters, and numbers. As children approach the \nage of 5, their art is better defined and can represent either reality or fantasy. They are highly \nattracted by materials that create interesting effects and are tactually stimulating.

Children become interested in craft projects \nthat were previously thought of as folk art or work-related crafts, such as simple woodworking or \nsewing (with large needles). They become interested in photography and simple jewelry making, \nlike beadwork. They can now use color pencils, art chalk, pastels, water colors, sketch pads, \nstencils,  sharper scissors, all kinds of art papers, printing equipment, cameras, miniature looms, \nplaster of Paris, papier-mâché, leather strips, and model-making, in addition to everything used \nby younger children.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"MEDIA PLAY"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#269","text":"scissors, all kinds of art papers, printing equipment, cameras, miniature looms, \nplaster of Paris, papier-mâché, leather strips, and model-making, in addition to everything used \nby younger children.

Musical and rhythm instruments can be appropriate for children of all \nages. \nOne should place primary emphasis or importance on the following characteristics when \ndetermining the age appropriateness of musical instruments: \n• Cause & Effect \n• Materials \n• Size of Parts \n• Number of Parts \nThe order of the above characteristics does not necessarily indicate priority because this can \nchange with age. The remaining discussion describes the relationship between the characteristics \nof these toys and the characteristics of children in various age groups. This includes a description \nof what types of musical instruments are appropriate and how a particular age group plays with \nthese products. \nBirth Through 3 Months \nChildren enjoy music at all ages. Musical instruments appropriate for children of this age range \nare rattles, bells, and chimes that can be strapped to the wrist or ankle when the child is unable to \ngrasp them. Musical toys that make sounds when they are kicked are also suitable for this age. \nAs they approach 4 months of age, children can grasp small-scale tambourines, handheld rattles, \nbells, and chimes.

Rhythm instruments are most appropriate for this \nage. Musical mobiles and gyms are also appropriate (see Exploratory and Practice Play: \nMirrors, Mobiles, & Manipulatives for more on mobiles and gyms). \n4 Through 7 Months \nAt this age, movements progress from reflexes to outwardly oriented movements. Most children \nare now actively engaged with their environments, repeating actions that involve external \nobjects. Most children now actively handle toys. Mouthing and teething are also very \ncharacteristic of this age group; although the time spent mouthing varies among individual \nchildren. They can sit unsupported at around 6 months of age. \nAppropriate musical instruments for children of this age range include rattles, bells, chimes, and \nsmall-scale tambourines that fit in children’s grasps. They are small and light enough for the \ninfant to handle, have rounded edges, and are both washable and sturdy.

Their behaviors become more outwardly initiated and goal-\noriented. Because of this increase in physical development and an increase in cognitive \ndevelopment, children around this age begin to understand simple cause-and-effect relationships. \nThe motor skills of grasping and shaking,  combined with the cognitive skill of understanding \ncause and effect, make musical instruments highly appealing for this age group. Children in this \n\nMedia Play: Musical Instruments \n225 \nage range can hold two objects at once, but are unable to coordinate the different actions of each \nappendage. They are practicing fine motor skills like grasping, pushing, pulling, squeezing, \npatting, poking, and shaking, and can be provided with musical instruments that fit these \ncharacteristics. Mouthing and teething are still very characteristic of this age group, although the \ntime spent mouthing varies among individual children. \nSuitable musical instruments for this age group have characteristics similar to the previous \ngroup.

Because of this, children are beginning to \nself-select toys, rather than play with the items put within their reach. Although they are \nbecoming more skilled at bipedal movement, they are still unsteady on their feet, and they \nfrequently lose their balance. They are working on fine motor coordination and are capable of \ncontrolled grasping and releasing, pushing, pulling, squeezing, patting, poking, and shaking. \nThey can also twist, turn, slide, and crank instruments.

They can use \ninstruments or simple sets that they can use in functional/exploratory ways, such as pounding on \ndrums or bongos.  At this age, children may be introduced to chunky whistles. They may blow \nshort bursts of air to generate sound on a whistle, or may mimicking a whistle sound with their \nvoice. These children are likely to suck in air as much as they are to blow it out.  \n19 Through 23 Months \nChildren from 19 through 23 months of age are still curious and love to explore. \nRepresentational and symbolic thinking emerges during this time. This is also a time of great \nphysical activity as children gain new strengths and skills in their gross motor development. \nThey are becoming more confident and stable in walking, and are exploring other physical skills \nlike balancing, jumping, and running. Their fine motor skills are also becoming more skillful. \nSocial play is starting to emerge as children are more capable of communicating with each other \nand beginning to play alongside each other.

Toys designed for this type of play \nrequire specific levels of knowledge and motor skill, so most toys in this category are \nrecommended for children 19 months and older. However, some parents may believe their \nchildren are advanced, or may desire to give their children a “head start” over others. \nConsequently, educational and academic toys might be given to children at younger ages than \ndescribed in the Age Determination Guidelines, even if they are inappropriate for children in this \nage group for developmental or safety reasons.\nBooks (p. 239) \n• ABC & number \n• Chapter \n• Cloth- or plastic-covered \n• Coloring \n• Information \n• Interactive \n• Nursery rhymes \n• Picture \n• Pop-up \n• Rhyming \n• Simple stories \n• Tactile \n• Vocabulary \nLearning Products (p. 253) \n• Abacuses \n• Architecture kits \n• Binoculars \n• Cameras \n• Chemistry sets \n• Circuit boards \n• Colors & shapes \n• Electronic teacher toys \n• Felt play boards \n• Flashcards \n• Machine building kits \n• Magnetic letters & numbers \n• Microscopes \n• Press & guess toys \n• Science sets \n• Telescopes \n• Wipe-off educational mats \n  \n\nEducational & Academic Play \n238","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"EDUCATIONAL & ACADEMIC PLAY"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#298","text":"shcards \n• Machine building kits \n• Magnetic letters & numbers \n• Microscopes \n• Press & guess toys \n• Science sets \n• Telescopes \n• Wipe-off educational mats \n  \n\nEducational & Academic Play \n238 \n  \n\nEducational & Academic Play \n239 \nBOOKS \nResearch strongly indicates that a child’s success in reading largely hinges on early experiences \nwith literature, particularly during preschool years at home and the first few years of school. \nUnless positive attitudes toward reading are developed during the early years, a child is unlikely \nto grow into an adult who enjoys reading. \nBooks are appropriate for children of most ages, but they are not used independently by children \nas sources of information or stories until they are around the age of 19 months. Before that, \nbooks serve as objects in the environment that are likely to be handled roughly (i.e., mouthed, \ncarried, ripped), or used by someone else to read them a story. Recent research indicates that \nreading to children as early as 1 month old can be beneficial to their auditory perception skills, \nemotional balance, and language comprehension and development. Some studies even encourage \nin-utero reading. Reading is a skill that comes to fruition around the ages of 5 to 7 years; so until \nthat time, children interact with picture books by visually exploring the details of illustrations. \nThey are not constrained by the written words, often making sounds that correspond to the \npictures, naming objects, and inventing stories. \nOne should place primary emphasis or importance on the following characteristics when \ndetermining the age appropriateness of books: \n• Number of Parts (pages) \n• Materials ( plastic/foam, cloth, cardboard, paper) \n• Size of Parts \n• Sensory Elements \n• Level of Realism/Detail \n• Color/Contrast \nThe order of the characteristics listed above does not necessarily indicate priority, because this \ncan change with age.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"EDUCATIONAL & ACADEMIC PLAY"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#299","text":"Size of Parts \n• Sensory Elements \n• Level of Realism/Detail \n• Color/Contrast \nThe order of the characteristics listed above does not necessarily indicate priority, because this \ncan change with age. The remaining discussion describes the relationship between the \ncharacteristics of these toys and the characteristics of children in various age groups. This \nincludes a description of what types of books are appropriate, and how a particular age group \nplays with books. These descriptions, however, do not apply to books read to children by \n\nEducational & Academic Play: Books \n240 \nparents, teachers, or older peers because in those cases, the child is not handling the book or \nreading on their own. These descriptions apply only to the interactions between children and \nbooks. \nBirth Through 3 Months \nEmerging research encourages parents to talk and to read to their children, even in-utero. \nHowever, children ages birth through 3 months lack the physical, cognitive, and visual abilities \nnecessary for interacting with books. \n4 Through 7 Months \nAt this age, children’s movements are progressing from involuntary reflexes to deliberate \noutwardly oriented movements. As the children mature, grasping, reaching, shaking,  and pulling \nbecome ways in which they can interact with the environment. Grasping is mastered around 6 \nmonths. Because of children’s emerging abilities, caregivers can give children ages 4 through 7 \nmonths of age books. Appropriate books have relatively few pages (no more than five) that are \neasy to turn, portray a simple, familiar image on each page, and have bright colors and high \nvisual contrasts. Children use visual skills to engage in play. Research studies indicate that \nchildren prefer yellow and red, to blue and green,  and favor patterns rather than solids by 3 \nmonths of age.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"EDUCATIONAL & ACADEMIC PLAY"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#300","text":"contrasts.

Therefore, when they are given books by 4 months old, books that have bright \nyellow and red pictures with high visual contrasts and patterns, these books are likely to be more \nappealing to children in this age group. Infants can handle books that are small (no more than \naround 4 to 8 inches in any direction) and light,  yet sturdy. Once a book is grasped, it is likely to \nbe mouthed immediately. Therefore, books for children in this age group are usually made to \nendure wetness without tearing or falling apart, such as books made from cloth or non-toxic \nplastic. Cloth and light plastic books are suitable for children 6 months and older; cardboard may \nbe too heavy and unwieldy for children in this age group.

Children at this age can easily turn pages in \nbooks, but their lack of motor control may result in torn pages. This age brings the cognitive \nability to understand simple cause-and-effect relationships, and this makes interactive books \nhighly appealing. Books with things to lift, open, or slide are appealing and cognitively \nstimulating. Children in this age group can handle books that are less than 6 or 8 inches in any \ndirection, are lightweight,  yet sturdy, and are washable, with no more than five easily turned \npages. The pictures in these books are simple and clear, with bright colors and high contrast. The \npictures typically represent familiar objects, animals, or people to aid language development; and \neach page includes only one or a few objects. Cloth and light plastic books are suitable for \nchildren in this age bracket, but cardboard may be too heavy and unwieldy. \n12 Through 18 Months  \nChildren’s emerging interests in novelty and exploration characterize the 12- through 18-month \nperiod. Tactile books, much like the cause/effect books described above, are appealing for this \nage group because children can interact with the book in ways not possible with regular books. \nThis is also a time of growing language capabilities; consequently, books that have rhymes, \nrhythm, and repetition are suitable for aiding in their developing skills.

They can turn pages \ncarefully and work to avoid tearing them. The child realizes that the book has a front and back, \nand that pictures have a top and a bottom. Cognitive abilities are developed to the point that they \ncan understand that the pictures tell a story and that what the adult is doing is called “reading.” \nThey now regularly name and point to familiar objects in books, and particularly enjoy listening \nto nursery rhymes and repeating them with adults. Therefore, picture books with simple stories, \nnursery rhymes, ABCs, and number books are appropriate.

Therefore, larger print is more appropriate than smaller print in books. Literacy \nskills are emerging as children enter preschool and kindergarten during these years. Books that \ncontain simple phonetic structure words and two to four sentences per page allow children to \npractice their reading with success and relatively little frustration. About 10 pages are sufficient \nfor beginning literacy books. \n6 Through 8 Years \nPage numbers, size of books, and book contents gradually become more complex as the child’s \nreading fluency increases. During these years, children learn to read with increasing fluency, and \ndevelop individual reading habits and preferences. Once literacy skills are acquired and \nmastered, children set their own pace for reading. \nChildren from 6 through 8 years have different topic interests in the stories they choose. \nIndividual literacy skills are becoming more frequent among children of this age bracket, and \nthey derive great pleasure in choosing their own books from library stacks, although they still \nenjoy being read to by an adult. Some topics enjoyed in the preschool years are still enjoyed by \nchildren over 6 years, like poetry and comics; but children in this age group have a new interest \nin fantasy, which largely dominates over the pleasure of reading about reality. Stories about good \nmagic, heroes, myths, legends, and fairy tales are popular with 6- and 7-year-olds. They enjoy \nstories about reality, if they are sensational, dramatic, or funny. They also enjoy non-fiction \nbooks about children, nature, science, and the Earth’s elements.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"EDUCATIONAL & ACADEMIC PLAY"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#307","text":"r with 6- and 7-year-olds.

Cognitive activity is \nparticularly high with young children who are learning all-new information. Cognition is gained \nthrough sensory experiences with the environment first, then later through abstract reasoning and \nthought. However, just because learning occurs as early as birth, learning products are not \nnecessarily appropriate for newborn children. Learning products have anticipated uses, specific \ngoals, and particular types of learning objectives. Thus, learning products are appropriate only \nfor older children who are cognitively ready for such elements of play. \nChildren do not use learning products for true learning (i.e., as tools for gaining information or \nstrengthening cognitive skills) on an independent level until they are around the age of 2 to 3 \nyears. For example, “learning products” are more appropriately considered “exploratory toys” or \n“activity toys,” and they mainly serve as objects with which children can learn about their \nsenses, develop their motor skills, and learn about cause and effect (see Exploratory and Practice \nPlay: Mirrors, Mobiles, & Manipulatives). Therefore, giving a true learning product to children \nyounger than 2 years of age is often inappropriate because children of that age lack the physical, \ncognitive, and visual abilities necessary for interacting with the product in most anticipated \nways.

They have developed the ability to remember past events up to a day, to concentrate \nand focus on one task for a limited time, and to attend to as many as three directions at once. The \ncause-and-effect relationships they began to understand at 12 months are now fully developed, so \ntoys using this skill are engaging. Children in this age group can use four- or five-word \nsentences. They can recognize and identify almost all common objects and pictures, and enjoy \nmatching or naming objects and shapes. Activities like these strengthen their visual \ndiscrimination skills. They also can understand the physical relationships between objects, such \nas knowing that something is “on” or “under” another object. The purpose of numbers in \ncounting objects is starting to become understood, so they can now understand the concept of \n“two.” Cognitively, the early math skill of ordering by size has developed (it emerges around 19 \nmonths of age), and by 2, children can readily sort and order nesting cups in a meaningful way.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"LEARNING PRODUCTS"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#319","text":"pt of \n“two.” Cognitively, the early math skill of ordering by size has developed (it emerges around 19 \nmonths of age), and by 2, children can readily sort and order nesting cups in a meaningful way. \nThis is different from previous age groups, which may have used the cups out of order to build or \nstack.

Suitable learning products teach colors, shapes, letters and sounds, and numbers. \n4 Through 5 Years \nPreschool children are ready for learning products and all the cognitive goals they bring. Literacy \nskills are beginning to emerge around 5 years. Children in this age group understand the way in \nwhich the toy should be used, can decipher the meanings of the words used (if the learning toy is \nelectronic), and know how to interact with the toy. Learning products that pertain to various \ndomains of knowledge are appropriate: colors, letter and sound recognition, letter writing, \nnumber identification, counting, matching quantities to numerals, shapes, comparison, \ndirectionality (concepts such as back/front, over/under, and in/on) and scientific thought, such as \nspace or biology. Preschool children can mentally work through problems and questions and \nenjoy practicing their intellectual abilities and acquiring facts. Fine motor skills are well \ndeveloped, so small pieces present relatively little challenge. \nAppropriate learning products for the preschool child include toys that teach colors and shapes, \nand simple letter and number concepts. For example, alphabet magnets and abacuses are \nappropriate. At this age, children will often search for the first letter of their name, or if they \nhave practiced, may be able to spell their own name with alphabet magnets.

Elementary-age children, particularly upper \nelementary, find realistic-looking learning products more appealing than those that look like \nchildren’s toys. They prefer to interact with real-world objects, rather than plastic replicas. \nChildren in this age group are ready for skill-specific toys, rather than those that focus on broad \nconcepts used by the preschoolers. Literacy is an emerging skill during these years; so toys that \nreinforce reading are appropriate. At age 6, children are still establishing the foundation of \nreading; by age 8 and 9, most are reading fluently and reading for content (see Educational & \nAcademic Play: Books). Growing math skills include simple addition and subtraction in the early \ngrades, and multiplication, division, and fractions in the later grades. \nChildren in this age group can use more sophisticated science and chemistry sets, microscopes \n(with slides and dissecting accessories), telescopes, and binoculars. They are interested in their \nown anatomy and elements in the world, so scientific exploration sets that allow dissecting and \nexamining slides are highly attractive.

In 2017, it was estimated that children between the ages of 0-8 years old spend \nmore than 2 hours each day with television, DVDs, computers, video games, and mobile devices. \nIt is through these devices that children are able to access games, music, programming, as well as \nfully use features of toys that are compatible with these devices. \nIt should be noted that the 2016 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines suggest that \nchildren under the age of 18 months should not use screen media (i.e., mobile devices, television, \ncomputers, or video games), except for video chatting (AAP, 2016a). Furthermore, it is \nsuggested that children 18-24 months should consume high-quality programming only with a \nparent present. As such, parents should be prudent in regulating the amount of time that children \nspend with screens. Likewise, for children ages 5-18 years old, the 2016 American Academy of \nPediatrics guidelines suggest that parents should ensure that their child exercises for an hour a \nday and sleeps 8-12 hours a night, and to make sure that media use does not cut into those two \nessential activities. They also suggest that children and adolescents avoid screen use before \nbedtime or in the bedroom, and encourage parents to be involved in their child’s online habits to \nprevent online predators. \nTechnology is rapidly changing.

This technology has fostered a new kind of play. Smart toys are toys \nthat can respond to the user’s play actions through sound, voice recognition, visual effect, or \nmovement. This new line of toys has various levels of sophistication, but essentially a smart toy \nis computer chip-based. Unlike simple battery-operated toys from past generations, smart toys \nand educational software/applications interact in more creative ways with the user. They also \nconnect to computers through an Internet connection, or a cord right into the computer, for \nincreased personalization and ability to respond to the user. \nCognitive abilities, those higher-order mental processes, like reasoning and problem solving, are \npresent at birth. At first, understanding is gained through sensory experiences with the \nenvironment, then later, through abstract reasoning and thought. However, even though learning \nbegins at birth, it does not mean that smart toys and computer software/applications are \nappropriate for newborn children. Some smart toys that record the child’s voice and pass this \ninformation along to remote servers may create security concerns and should be taken into \nconsideration during the product design phase. Like learning products, smart toys and \neducational software/applications have anticipated uses, specific goals, and particular types of \nplay objectives. They are appropriate only for children who have reached an appropriate level of \ncognition for such elements of play. Children younger than 2 years of age lack the physical, \ncognitive, and visual abilities necessary to interact with toys or computer software/applications \nin expected ways; toys for those children are discussed in Exploratory and Practice Play: \nMirrors, Mobiles, & Manipulatives or Technology Play: Computer & Video Games.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"SMART TOYS & EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#333","text":"computer software/applications \nin expected ways; toys for those children are discussed in Exploratory and Practice Play: \nMirrors, Mobiles, & Manipulatives or Technology Play: Computer & Video Games. \nOne should place primary emphasis or importance on the following characteristics when \ndetermining the age appropriateness of smart toys and educational software/applications: \n• Sensory Elements \n• Motor Skills Required \n• Education \n• Level of Realism/Detail \n• Materials \n\nTechnology Play: Smart Toys & Educational Software \n266 \nThe order of the characteristics does not necessarily indicate priority because this can change \nwith age.

They have developed the ability to remember past events up to a \nday, to concentrate and focus on one task for a limited time, and to attend to as many as three \ndirections at once. The cause-and-effect relationships they began to understand at 12 months are \nnow fully developed, so toys using this skill are engaging. Children in this age group can use \nfour- or five-word sentences. They can recognize and identify almost all common objects and \npictures, and enjoy matching or naming objects and shapes. Activities like these strengthen their \nvisual discrimination skills.

Children in this age group are generally farsighted and \nare still developing their binocular vision. Therefore, they can view more easily larger print and \npictures. Because children prefer red and yellow colors, suitable visuals for these toys are bright \nand based on primary colors. Children’s attention spans are short, so appropriate visuals in \nsoftware are those that offer variety in what they are presenting the child through the use of lots \nof movement, large characters, or energetic sound effects.

The volume level, \nlength of the video program, visual images, language presentation, and content/theme \nrepresented in the music or show, determine the age for whom the audio and video elements are \nappropriate. Audiovisual equipment can be appropriate for children of all ages, but parents must \noperate this equipment for younger children. The following discussion describes in detail how \nvarious age groups engage in audio/video play and what types of music and visuals are \nappropriate for those ages. These descriptions do not, however, apply to computer or video \ngames. Those types of visuals are addressed in the Computer & Video Games subcategory. \nOne should place primary emphasis or importance on the following characteristics when \ndetermining the age appropriateness of audio/video equipment: \n• Sensory Elements \n• Length of Video or Audio Track \n• Level of Realism/Detail \n• Level of Complexity \nThe order of the above characteristics does not necessarily indicate priority because this can \nchange with age. The remaining discussion describes the relationship between the characteristics \nof these toys and the characteristics of children in various age groups. This includes a description \nof what types of audiovisual equipment are appropriate and how a particular age group plays \nwith this equipment. \nBirth Through 3 Months, 4 Through 7 Months \nMuch research has been conducted to discover what newborn children can hear.

Children \n\nTechnology Play: Audiovisual Equipment \n278 \nespecially enjoy gentle repeated rhythms and exaggerated speech sounds. For example, children \nless than 3 months old enjoy “heartbeat” rhythms. \nChildren use their discriminative sensitivities to distinguish speech sounds as early as 1 month of \nage. Between the ages of 3 and 6 months, the infant can localize sounds, babble, and make \nsinging sounds with adults. Children between 4 and 7 months of age can tell the difference \nbetween a lullaby and an adult-directed song,  even when the song and lullaby came from a \nforeign culture. Seven-month-olds can distinguish sentence tunes, imitate sounds and sound \nsequences, and make singing sounds to music. Therefore, audio equipment with soft, rhythmic, \nor human voices are more appropriate than audio equipment with loud, jarring sounds. Audio \nequipment that includes language that children can imitate or accompany is appropriate. Children \nin this age group are attracted to Internet streaming audio, mp3s, CDs, or other audio sources of \nlullabies, simple songs, rhythms or nursery rhymes that have gentle, predictable sounds and are \nplayed at low volumes. Music boxes wound by an adult are also appropriate. \nA newborn’s visual acuity is about 20/400 to 20/800, which means that a newborn sees the same \nlevel of detail at 20 feet that a normal-vision adult can see at 400 to 800 feet. By 3 months of \nage, acuity improves to around 20/100. Children younger than 1 month old have eye lenses that \ndo not vary in their focus on distance, a process called visual accommodation. Rather, their \nlenses seem to be fixed for optimal focus at a distance of about 8 inches. Visual accommodation \nimproves between 1 and 3 months of age and is almost adult-like by the time children are 6 \nmonths old.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"AUDIOVISUAL EQUIPMENT"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#351","text":"lenses seem to be fixed for optimal focus at a distance of about 8 inches.

By 3 months, children \nprefer yellow and red to blue and green and favor patterns over solids. Due to children \ndeveloping vision capabilities and limited range of vision, video play is generally not \nappropriate. However, these children will watch television and videos that are geared toward \nthem. \n8 Through 11 Months \nEight- through 11-month-olds enjoy participating in finger-play, sing-song games, such as “So \nBig,” “This Little Pig,” and “Pat-a-Cake.” Audio equipment that includes language that children \n\nTechnology Play: Audiovisual Equipment \n279 \ncan imitate or accompany is appropriate.

While \nyounger children can hear better at low than high frequencies, the auditory sensitivity of children \nin this age group has improved more for higher than for lower sounds and is as good as an \nadult’s. Therefore, increasing the range of auditory stimuli is appropriate during this age. Around \n12 months of age, children try to sing to themselves and can listen to rhymes and jingles. As they \napproach 2 years, they try to repeat nursery rhymes. Just as they were in infancy, children are \ninterested in sounds and repetition. Children have developed the fine motor skills necessary to \noperate a hand-cranked music box, but they cannot manipulate wind-up models. \nAt this age, children are very interested in visual screens.

They like to perform by doing dances, somersaults, and “tricks.” \nThey frequently seek attention for their dance moves by first saying, “Watch this!” They love \nmusic and playing along with rhythm instruments. They also enjoy simple stories read from \npicture books or CDs, Internet streaming audio, and mp3s. \nExposing children to a wide range of music styles is suitable to help them develop preferences \nand tastes.

Their sense of hearing \nis well developed by this age, but their ability to perceive subtle phonological distinctions in \nsounds, such as consonant blends (this is necessary for mastering the phonetic combinations of \nlanguage), is not developed until about age 6 in most children. This is why words are frequently \nmispronounced, even with repeated correction by adults. \nMusic play is beneficial for children’s developing auditory/language skills. Songs that have \nrhymes and word plays help them hear words in a variety of ways, and with repeated exposure, \nthey can self-correct their mispronunciation. Preschool children enjoy listening to songs that \npertain to familiar events, and they enjoy hearing them repeatedly. Three-year-old children enjoy \nplaying with words and silly rhymes and can remember the words of many songs. \nSinging, dancing, and playing instruments along with music are highly appealing activities. \nPreschoolers enjoy rhythm instruments and like dressing up for dancing. In addition, their sense \nof humor is becoming more refined, so silly songs are appealing. Folk songs, finger plays, \nrhythmic music, music for dancing, and recorded stories about animals, adventures, and other \nplaces are popular among this age group. Preschoolers are cognitively and physically capable of \noperating simple mobile applications to play music, CD/mp3 players, and radios designed for \nchildren.

Preschool children have the fine motor skills necessary to \nmanipulate wind-up music boxes, but adults must consider the appropriateness of individual \nmusic boxes because some are fragile and more suitable for older children. \nVideo play for preschoolers is very similar to that of younger children.

Songs sung \nin kindergarten classrooms are considered “babyish” to first graders, who are largely interested \nin the latest pop star’s music or more adult-appropriate varieties of music. This trend continues, \nalthough music tastes and preferences tend to change throughout childhood. Individual \npreferences in music are the rule; some children like popular music, some like classical music, \nsome like folk music, some like musical comedies, some like “introduction to orchestra” music, \nand some like none.

Because they now have the \ncognitive capabilities for abstract thought, they can participate in interpretive dance, like \nrepresenting fire, storm, and birds, through their movements. Other forms of appealing music are \nalso connected to dance: folk songs for folk dance, songs with clapping and shouting, and fast \nmusic for skipping, galloping, and step clapping. Music or dance lessons and exposure to \ndifferent kinds of music may affect the child’s interest. \nPlastic audio players are replaced with “real” equipment, including digital music players, CD \nplayers, headphones, and stereos.

very popular for adults and children, and those designed for \nchildren are evolving quickly. Therefore, the guidelines for these particular toys may require \nregular updates and include information on both current and potential applications of computer \ntechnology. As of 2016, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) suggested that children \nunder the age of 18 months should not use screen media (i.e., mobile devices, television, \ncomputers, or video games), except for video chatting (AAP, 2016a). Furthermore, they suggested \nchildren 18-24 months consume high-quality media programming only with a parent, and children \nolder than age 2 not consume more than an hour of screen time each day. With that said, \nchildren’s products and toys in this category for infants and toddlers will continue to exist, and as \nsuch, we have included some guidelines here. \nComputers are often used to play games, but they also can be used to produce a wide variety of \nresponses, such as playing digital music and films, as well as playing with a wide range of \nsoftware. All are attractive to a wide age range of children.  Because computer technology is \nchanging rapidly, these guidelines define a computer rather broadly to cover the wide range of \npotential computer uses for children. A computer consists of three basic elements: an input \ndevice, an output device, and a processor to adjust the output based on the input, all of which can \nbe part of a single device like a tablet, or multiple, separate parts, like a computer with a separate \nmonitor, keyboard, and mouse. \nAn input device for a desktop or laptop computer is typically a keyboard and mouse.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"TECHNOLOGY PLAY: AUDIOVISUAL EQUIPMENT"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#369","text":"e device like a tablet, or multiple, separate parts, like a computer with a separate \nmonitor, keyboard, and mouse. \nAn input device for a desktop or laptop computer is typically a keyboard and mouse.

Extremely sensitive input devices \nthat detect small movements exist to make computers accessible for all ages. For example, an \ninput device incorporated into an infant’s pacifier can detect sucking and change the output, \ndepending on whether the sucking has started or stopped. Input devices for computers can be in \nremote locations away from the computer and can take a number of forms, like a plush animal or \nfigurine. For more complex activities, the input device will be more sophisticated. Keyboards, \njoysticks, and handheld controllers allow for more complex input. These become more \nappropriate for older children who have the physical and cognitive skills required to use them.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"TECHNOLOGY PLAY: AUDIOVISUAL EQUIPMENT"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#370","text":"cated.

The \nprocessor for a computer generally is based on the software or mobile applications in use on the \ncomputer. Software and applications for children may include simple cause-and-effect activities, \ngames, observational programs, and educational software. \nComputer-based products appeal to many ages. They are interactive and multisensory, so they \nwill appeal to children in a number of ways.  Some scholars argue that a touch-screen tablet \ndevice has most of the features of traditional toys (i.e., they can respond to something the child \nhas done, they can promote joint attention between child and parent, and they are highly \nportable).  The scholars also mention that a touchscreen tablet has features that traditional toys do \nnot usually have (i.e., they are tailorable to the child’s needs and preferences, and the child can \nstop playing and easily arrive where he/she left off).  Additionally, some parents view certain \ncomputer-based products as educational, which appeals to parents who want their children \nengaged in an activity that can promote learning.  One should place primary emphasis or \nimportance on the following characteristics when determining the age appropriateness of \ncomputer and video games: \n• Sensory Elements \n• Cause & Effect \n• Licensed theme \n• Motor Skills Required \n• Educational \nThe order of these characteristics does not necessarily indicate priority because this can change \nwith age.

The remaining discussion describes the relationship between the characteristics of these \ntoys and the characteristics of children in various age groups. This includes a description of what \ntypes of computer and video games are appropriate and how a particular age group plays with \nthese games. Parental supervision is generally required for children under 3 years of age because \nmost computers have been designed for use by adults, not by children. \n\nTechnology Play: Computer & Video Games \n295 \nBirth Through 3 Months \nAt this age, children learn mostly through reflexes, such as spontaneous kicking and arm \nmovements. Input devices that can detect the movements and reflex actions of this age group—\nlike arm and leg movements, sucking, or sounds like crying—can be used to adjust output \ndevices. Output for this age group could include sound systems that play recorded sounds like the \nmother’s voice or other soothing sounds based on reception from the input device. Other \nappropriate output could include projection screens that display slow-moving, distinct-colored \npatterns in the infant’s visual range—about 8 inches from the face in the first month, and several \nfeet away by the end of this age period—or that focus and un-focus, depending on the actions of \nthe infant. The most appealing projection patterns would emphasize high-contrast colors that \nchildren birth through 3 months of age can differentiate, such as red and green, or black and \nwhite. Faces also are especially attractive to children in this age group. Appropriate output \ndevices are limited to one or two events to let children make the connection between their actions \nand the response of the output device. \n4 Through 7 Months \nChildren ages 4 through 7 months are engaging with the environment in more systematic ways. \nTheir movements are also much more sophisticated, which allows for a greater range of input \ndevices.","market":"US","source":"CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf","section":"TECHNOLOGY PLAY: AUDIOVISUAL EQUIPMENT"},{"id":"US/CPSC_Age_Determination_Guidelines_2020.pdf#372","text":"nths \nChildren ages 4 through 7 months are engaging with the environment in more systematic ways. \nTheir movements are also much more sophisticated, which allows for a greater range of input \ndevices. Input devices that allow for patting, grasping, pulling, and squeezing can be appropriate \nfor this age. These input devices can be embedded in plush toys; such a device could adjust a \nscreen, turn on lights, or play recorded sounds. Mouthing is also a characteristic of this age group, \nso input devices that can detect and react to mouthing are appropriate for this age group. A low \nnumber of output events will minimize confusion about cause-and-effect relationships for \nchildren in this age group. \n8 Through 11 Months \nComputers could be designed to take advantage of the increased mobility of 8 through 11 month-\nold children. These children can hold and shake an input device. Devices that adjust their \nresponse, depending on the child’s input, can challenge an infant to be persistent in trying new \naction schemes on the device.

Children of this age are \nbeginning to understand cause-and-effect relationships. Therefore, the number of potential output \nevents can be increased,  so individual changes in input can be associated with individual outputs. \nFor example, banging may bring a sound, while shaking may cause the projection of different \npatterns of colors. Children in this age group can sit unsupported and stand with support, so \nprojection screens can be moved to the vertical position. \n12 Through 18 Months \nChildren 12 through 18 months of age are very curious and are interested in exploring their \nenvironment. Most children begin walking unsupported at this age and can approach popular and \nfamiliar objects, which could include computer projection screens. Input devices for this age \ngroup can have multiple buttons that produce different responses when pressed. Suitable input \ndevices are durable and are able to withstand heavy use. Vertical screens are appropriate for this \nage, as are output devices that produce sound and movement. \n19 Through 23 Months \nChildren 19 through 23 months of age are more coordinated walkers. They have mastered cause-\nand-effect responses and are very interested in coordinated multisensory responses, including \nsound, movement, and visual responses. Symbolic play begins to emerge at this age, which allows \nfor computer outputs that have some sort of pretend element.

Children \nin this age group are also comfortable using touchscreen devices and are able to respond easily to \ntouch-sensitive areas on a screen. \n2 Years \nTwo-year-old children are increasingly social, so interactive programs that can respond to \nchildren’s actions are appropriate. Children in this age group can recognize and are attracted to \n\nTechnology Play: Computer & Video Games \n297 \npopular characters from television and movies. They can follow simple instructions from an \ninteractive computer. In addition, they enjoy watching projected stories and can use input devices \nto start and restart story-reading programs, mobile applications, and CD/DVDs. Children at this \nage can insert CD/DVDs into desktop and laptop computers, but the program needs to self-start \nbecause, on average, the2-year-olds will not be able to complete more than two or three simple \ncommands on the computer, and cannot perform sequential actions. Because children interact \nwith computers without concern for consequences, software for children should not allow the \nchild to reset computer settings.  Children in this age group continue to be able to use touchscreen \ntablet devices and are able to use their fingers to provide input. \n3 Years \nThree-year-olds are beginning to take an interest in computer games. They enjoy looking at action \non the screen. Computer games that involve reading are generally inappropriate because most 3-\nyear-olds cannot read.

In general, 3-year-olds cannot use a traditional keyboard to input information into \nthe computer, other than having the keyboard respond to all key presses in the same way. Three-\nyear-olds understand basic rules of games, like turn taking. However, activity games without a \nspecific goal are best for this age group. Painting and drawing games are popular as well.

Although most 4- and 5-year-olds are developing their reading abilities, they \ngenerally cannot use written directions. Activity games with a physical component are still very \npopular with this age group. Four- and five-year-olds can use keyboards, along with a mouse, to \nnavigate, but this is often a slow method of input. Touchscreen devices, as input devices, continue \nto be easier to use than a computer with a keyboard and mouse. Children in this age group remain \ninterested in simple painting and drawing programs, book-reading programs, and simple \nmultimedia development. Prototypical toys show children in this age group enjoy interacting with \na laptop, if a toy goes along with it as the input device (e.g., an RFID tag inserted into the toy that \nwould activate the images on the laptop), with children intrigued by the immediate contingency of \nthe plush toys to something onscreen. This age group is interested in the creative aspect of \ncomputers, like drawing or painting; and they are also interested in the fantasy or pretend element \ncomputers offer, like interacting with story characters. Children at this age have the fine motor \nskills and visual discrimination to use simple console and handheld computer games, but they find \nit difficult to coordinate movement between their two hands; they can focus on only one hand and \none aspect at the same time. \n6 Through 8 Years \nComputer games for children in this age group are increasingly sophisticated.

standardization comprising \nall   national   electrotechnical   committees   (IEC   National   Committees).   The   object   of   IEC   is   to   promote \ninternational co-operation on all questions concerning standardization in the electrical and electronic fields. To \nthis  end  and  in  addition  to  other  activities,  IEC  publishes  International  Standards,  Technical  Specifications,  \nTechnical   Reports,   Publicly   Available   Specifications   (PAS)   and   Guides   (hereafter   referred   to   as   “IEC   \nPublication(s)”). Their preparation is entrusted to technical committees; any IEC National Committee interested \nin  the  subject  dealt  with  may  participate  in  this  preparatory  work.  International,  governmental  and  non-\ngovernmental  organizations  liaising  with  the  IEC  also  participate  in  this  preparation.  IEC  collaborates  closely  \nwith  the  International  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO)  in  accordance  with  conditions  determined  by  \nagreement between the two organizations. \n2)   The formal decisions or agreements of IEC on technical matters express, as nearly as possible, an international \nconsensus  of  opinion  on  the  relevant  subjects  since  each  technical  committee  has  representation  from  all \ninterested IEC National Committees.  \n3)   IEC  Publications  have  the  form  of  recommendations  for  international  use  and  are  accepted  by  IEC  National  \nCommittees  in  that  sense.  While  all  reasonable  efforts  are  made  to  ensure  that  the  technical  content  of  IEC  \nPublications  is  accurate,  IEC  cannot  be  held  responsible  for  the  way  in  which  they  are  used  or  for  any  \nmisinterpretation by any end user.","market":"EUROPE","source":"EN_62115_Electric_Toys_Safety.pdf","section":"ELECTRIC TOYS – SAFETY"},{"id":"EUROPE/EN_62115_Electric_Toys_Safety.pdf#36","text":"that  the  technical  content  of  IEC  \nPublications  is  accurate,  IEC  cannot  be  held  responsible  for  the  way  in  which  they  are  used  or  for  any  \nmisinterpretation by any end user. \n4)   In  order  to  promote  international  uniformity,  IEC  National  Committees  undertake  to  apply  IEC  Publications  \ntransparently  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  in  their  national  and  regional  publications.

Their characteristics are related to the age and stage of development of the children \nand their intended use presupposes certain capabilities. \nAccidents are frequently due to an electric toy either being given to a child for whom it is not \nintended or being used for a purpose other than for which it was designed. This standard does \nnot  eliminate  parental  responsibility  for  the  appropriate  selection  of  electric  toys.  It  is  \nassumed  that  when  choosing  an  electric  toy  or  a  game,  account  is  taken  of  the  physical  and  \nmental development of the child who will be playing with it. \nThe  aim  of  this  standard  is  to  reduce  risks  when  playing  with  electric  toys,  especially  those  \nrisks  that  are  not  evident  to  users.  However,  it  has  to  be  recognized  that  some  electric  toys \nhave  risks  inherent  in  their  use  that  cannot  be  avoided.  Consideration  has  been given  to  \nreasonably  foreseeable  use,  bearing  in  mind  that  children  are  not  generally  as  careful  as  \nadults. \nWhile  this  standard  applies  to  new  electric  toys,  it  nevertheless  takes  into  account  the  wear  \nand tear of electric toys in use. \nThe  fact  that  an  electric  toy  complies  with  this  standard  does  not  absolve  parents  and  other  \npersons  in  charge  of  a  child  from  the  responsibility  of  supervising  the  child.  Supervision  is  \nalso necessary when children of various ages have access to the same electric toy.","market":"EUROPE","source":"EN_62115_Electric_Toys_Safety.pdf","section":"INTRODUCTION"},{"id":"EUROPE/EN_62115_Electric_Toys_Safety.pdf#44","text":"other  \npersons  in  charge  of  a  child  from  the  responsibility  of  supervising  the  child.

This  results  \nin  different  requirements  and  tests  according  to  the  type  of  electric  toy.  For  some  electric  \ntoys, testing can be reduced if particular criteria are met (see Clause 6).  \nOther safety aspects of electric toys are described in the ISO 8124 series of standards. \nAn  electric  toy  that  complies  with  the  text  of  this  standard  will  not  necessarily  be  judged  to  \ncomply  with  the  safety  principles  of  the  standard  if,  when  examined  and  tested,  it  is  found  to  \nhave other features that impair the level of safety covered by these requirements. \nA electric toy employing materials or having forms of construction differing from those detailed \nin  the  requirements  of  this  standard  may  be  examined  and  tested  according  to  the  intent  of  \nthe  requirements  and,  if  found  to  be  substantially  equivalent,  may  be  judged  to  comply  with  \nthe standard. \nElectrotechnical   Commission   (IEC)   draws   attention   to   the   fact   that   it   is   claimed   that   \ncompliance with this document may involve the use of a patent.  \nIEC takes no position concerning the evidence, validity and scope of this patent right. \nThe holder of this patent  right has assured the IEC that they are willing to negotiate licences \nunder reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions with applicants throughout the \nworld.

The user of this part oflSO 8124 is therefore advised to be aware \nof relevant national requirements. \nCompliance with the requirements of this part of ISO 8124 will minimize potential hazards associated \nwith toys resulting from their use in their intended play modes (normal use) as well as unintended play \nmodes (reasonably foreseeable abuse). \nThis \npart oflSO 8124 will not, nor is it intended to, eliminate parental responsibility in the appropriate \nselection of toys. In addition, this \npart of ISO 8124 will not eliminate the need for parental supervision \nin situations where children of various ages may have access \nto the same toy(s). \nAlthough Annexes \nA, E, G,]2, E and E are for information purposes only, they are crucial for the correct \ninterpretation of this \npart oflSO 8124. \nThe safety of electric toys is described \nin IEC 62115. \nWhen age indications are required for safety labelling purposes, they may be given in either months oryears. \nviii \n© ISO 2014 -All rights reserved \n\nCopyrighted material licensed to Bureau Veritas.

They are applicable to a toy as it is \ninitially received by the consumer and, in addition, they apply \nafter a  toy is subjected to reasonably \nforeseeable conditions of normal use and abuse unless specifically noted otherwise. \nThe requirements of this \npart of ISO 8124 specify acceptable criteria for structural characteristics of \ntoys, such as shape, size, contour, spacing \n(e.g. rattles, small parts, sharp points and edges, and hinge-\nline clearances) as well as acceptable criteria for properties peculiar to certain categories of toy (e.g. \nmaximum kinetic energy values for non-resilient-tipped projectiles and minimum tip angles for certain \nride-on toys). \nThis \npart of ISO 8124 specifies requirements and test methods for toys intended for use by children in \nvarious age groups from \nbirth to 14 years. The requirements vary according to the age group for which a \nparticulartoy is intended. The requirements for a particular age group reflect the nature of the hazards \nand the expected mental \nand/or physical abilities of a child to cope with them. \nThis \npart of ISO 8124 also requires that appropriate warnings and/or instructions for use be given on \ncertain toys \nor their packaging. Due to linguistic problems which may occur in different countries, the \nwording of these warnings and instructions is not specified but given as general information in Annex B. \nIt should be noted that different legal requirements exist in many countries with regard to such marking. \nThis \npart of ISO 8124 does not purport to cover or include every conceivable potential hazard of a \nparticular toy \nor toy category.","market":"MIDDLE_EAST","source":"ISO_8124-1_2014_Version.pdf","section":"INTERNATIONAL STANDARD"},{"id":"MIDDLE_EAST/ISO_8124-1_2014_Version.pdf#156","text":"requirements exist in many countries with regard to such marking. \nThis \npart of ISO 8124 does not purport to cover or include every conceivable potential hazard of a \nparticular toy \nor toy category. Except for labelling requirements indicating the functional hazards \nand the age range for which the toy is intended, this part of ISO 8124 has no requirements for those \ncharacteristics of toys which represent an inherent and recognized hazard which is integral to \nthe \nfunction of the toy. \nEXAMPLE 1 An example of such a hazard is the sharp point necessary for the proper function ofa needle. The \nneedle is  a hazard which is well understood by the purchaser \nof a toy sewing kit, and the functional sharp-point \nhazard is communicated to the user as part \nof the normal educational process of learning to sew as well as at the \npoint of purchase by means \nof cautionary labelling on the product's packaging. \nEXAMPLE 2 As a further example, a two-wheeled toy scooter has inherent and recognized hazards associated \nwith its use (e.g. instability during \nuse, especially while learning).

In order for a toy to enhance play time, it obviously \nmust be appealing to its user. \nIn short, it has to be fun. \nA.3 Resources for establishing age grades \nUse of the following can help guide the establishment of meaningful age grading for a toy.","market":"MIDDLE_EAST","source":"ISO_8124-1_2014_Version.pdf","section":"5.37 Length of suction cup projectiles"},{"id":"MIDDLE_EAST/ISO_8124-1_2014_Version.pdf#400","text":"usly \nmust be appealing to its user. \nIn short, it has to be fun. \nA.3 Resources for establishing age grades \nUse of the following can help guide the establishment of meaningful age grading for a toy.

Bicycles for \nchildren with a \nseat height ranging from 435 mm to 635 mm are specified in ISO 8098. \nb) \"Compressed-air and gas-operated guns and pistols\" refers to weapons which use high-compressed \nair or other gases to eject metal or plastic bullets or small darts and which are often used by adults \nin competitions. In many countries there are legal restrictions on the sale of such guns to children. \nThe exemption does not include toy guns, which for example eject water by means \nof compressed air. \nc) \"Models of aircraft, rockets, boats and land vehicles powered by combustion engines\" also includes \nthe engine itself as well \nas spare parts. \nd) \n\"Fashion jewellery for children\" does not include jewellery which is part of, e.g. a  doll and is not \nintended to be worn by a child. Nor does \nit include kits for making jewellery. \nE.2 Normal use \nSeeU. \nThe objective of these tests is to simulate the normal play mode of the toy, and the tests are therefore \nunrelated to \nthe reasonably foreseeable abuse tests required in <!.l (reasonably foreseeable abuse).

It is necessary to exercise caution \nto ensure conformity to each of the relevant specifications and standards. For mineral water (in the soft \ndrink category) in particular, there are many specifications and standards that are applied according to the \nproperties of the product, which complicates conformity. \n●\nConfirmation of use of food additives\n    Food additives that can be manufactured, imported, used, and sold are limited to those designated \nby the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, excluding existing additives, natural flavoring agents, and \ngeneral drinks being used as additives.","market":"JAPAN_KOREA","source":"Japan_PSE_Guide_Import.pdf","section":"JAS"},{"id":"JAPAN_KOREA/Japan_PSE_Guide_Import.pdf#21","text":"ted, used, and sold are limited to those designated \nby the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, excluding existing additives, natural flavoring agents, and \ngeneral drinks being used as additives.
